<h1 style="text-align: center">Best Referral Program Ever?</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Raizlabs is always looking for great hires, and you can help!  Refer qualified candidates to Raizlabs and if your candidate is hired, you will have a $3,500 budget to be used toward a trip. Plan your own, or let us plan a 4-day, 3-night vacation for you from one of these options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sightseeing and shopping in a European destination</li>
<li>Dogsledding and winter fun in Maine</li>
<li>Weekend getaway in Vegas</li>
<li>Diving in the Florida Keys</li>
</ul>
<p>All you have to do is refer a friend who is an amazing developer, designer, or anyone that fits any of our <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/company/jobs/">open positions.</a> If they are hired, pack your bags.</p>
<p>No, you don't have to know someone at Raizlabs to get in on this deal. All you need is 52 seconds to fill out the referral form.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 5px">
<p>So what are you waiting for?</p>

<p style="text-align: left">The fine print:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: left">Referral Eligibility: You must be 21 years or older to participate.  This program is open to parents, friends, and even competitors.  Human Resources personnel, recruiters, and Raizlabs managers with hiring authority over the referred candidates are not eligible for participation.</li>
<li style="text-align: left">The referral must represent the candidate's first contact with Raizlabs (i.e. this is the first time the candidate is applying to Raizlabs) and the referral must be made by the referrer via the online form or via documented communication to the Talent Acquisition Manager to be eligible for the award.</li>
<li style="text-align: left">Temporary, summer, contract and former employees of Raizlabs will not qualify referrers for the award.</li>
<li style="text-align: left">The hired employee must be employed with Raizlabs for 60 days in order for the referrer to qualify for an award.</li>
<li style="text-align: left">All vacation packages must be taken within a 1-year period from the day the new employee has completed his/her initial 60 days of employment with Raizlabs.</li>
<li style="text-align: left">Raizlabs reserves the right to plan all trips.  Trip locations are subject to availability and may change.</li>
<li style="text-align: left">To qualify for reimbursement for a trip not planned by Raizlabs, proof of payment for a booked trip must be submitted for reimbursement.</li>
<li style="text-align: left">Earned trips may not be transferred and must be accepted as awarded.</li>
<li style="text-align: left">The value of a trip may be treated as income to a referrer and the referrer may be responsible for reporting and payment of income taxes.  Referrers will be required to complete a W-9 Form.</li>
