<h1>The Best Xamarin App Development</h1>
<p><a href="http://a16z.com/2014/10/28/mobile-is-eating-the-world/">Mobile is eating the world</a>. Your business needs to keep pace.</p>
<p>Deciding on the right mobile technology approach can be difficult when your business needs to have a mobile app run across many different devices and platforms. Here at Raizlabs, we're experts in mobile across technology consulting &amp; strategy, user experience design, and app development. If you decide that a middleware approach like Xamarin is right for you, we will be your partner every step of the way.</p>
<p>With <a href="http://xamarin.com/">Xamarin</a>, apps are written entirely in C#. This allows all platforms and devices to share the same code—whether that platform is iOS, Android, Windows, or Mac. Xamarin apps use standard UI controls, so the Xamarin apps we build looks and behave the way users expect them to.</p>
<h1>Your Xamarin App Development Partner</h1>
<p>If you prefer to build fully native mobile apps to ensure the highest possible level experience for you users, we can design and build that. If your business leaders have decided to combine resources and build cross-platform mobile apps with Xamarin, we can design and build that too.</p>
<p>Our first Xamarin project came from a client who's IT leaders determined that a cross-platform, same code approach was best. Despite generally building fully native apps, we were excited to get to work. Since then, we have built custom Xamarin apps and native for businesses and enterprises—from startups to Fortune 500 companies—and we will work with your organization to design and build what is right for you.</p>
<h1>Is Xamarin Right For Your Business?</h1>
<p>We regularly consult with businesses on their mobile strategy. We can help identify and build solutions to your most difficult technology problems. Whether you need a full partner in mobile to design and build your technology, or you just need a consulting partner to determine a mobile strategy going forward for you business—we can help.</p>
