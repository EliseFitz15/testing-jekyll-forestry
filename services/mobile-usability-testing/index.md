<p>Usability testing is a mechanism for receiving feedback, ultimately reducing the time and risk that comes with developing new products or features.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Using functional prototypes, we set up one-on-one sessions with existing or potential new users to determine the usability of design and development possibilities. This allows for the most direct and representative feedback, and it can help us assess things like user experience and the implementation of new features.</p>
<p>Using actual devices allows us to assess true interaction across various usage types. It also allows us to observe issues like button occlusion and hand/content overlap issues.</p>
<p>Mobile usability testing is a key aid to the iterative development cycle, allowing us to learn true usage patterns and incorporate findings into new versions of the application.</p>

<p>Ensuring the Greatest Return on Investment</p>
<p>With paper prototypes, we are able to test designs early and often, ensuring development that is intuitive and engaging. The users interact with the paper prototype in the same way that they would a functional one, but with less development time. Paper prototyping allows users to interact with the designed interface and validate it, without requiring us to use design resources.</p>

<p>Learning and Experience Lead to Better Design</p>
<p>If you have an existing application design and you’re looking for some guidance on your product, a heuristic evaluation can be a quick way for you to get feedback.</p>
<p>Our experts will assess problems with the user interface, answering such large structural questions as: Does the User Interface allow the users to achieve all of their goals? Does the flow make sense? Are features being appropriately highlighted?</p>
<p>Our mobile experts can provide actionable feedback based on best-practice experience across iPhone, iPad and Android products. The results of a typical evaluation include a full report on observed issues and high-level recommendations. While this evaluation isn’t as observational as a more formal usability test, it does provide a way to get quick, actionable feedback.</p>
<h2>Aesthetic Surveys</h2>
<p>Broad Feedback for New Insight</p>
<p>Conducting basic surveys on the aesthetics of the design can often provide insight overlooked by those closest to the project. Since design is subjective, we can conduct a study to give you objective data across a larger pool of people. In aesthetic surveys, we look for:</p>
<p>• Legibility: Can people read the text and the font?<br />
• Contrast: Does the design work in both low-light and sunlight conditions?<br />
• Attractiveness: Does a cross section of your target demographic find the design attractive?</p>
