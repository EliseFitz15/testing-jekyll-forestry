<h1 class="highlight">Virtual Reality</h1>
<p>Here at Raizlabs, we invest in innovation. We've built our company by experimenting with technology, starting with the release of the iPhone's first SDK in 2008. We were one of the first companies devoting to developing several of the most popular apps in the app store (<a href="https://www.raizlabs.com/blog/work/">https://www.raizlabs.com/blog/work/</a>).</p>
<p>A few years have passed, our team has quadrupled in size, and our client list is a bit longer, but we haven’t given up on the start-up mentality that led us to successfully build products used by millions.</p>
<h2 class="highlight">Virtual Reality Applications</h2>
<p>We have seen a steady rise in the interest of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) from our clients and across the industry, primarily due to the recent price drop in VR consumer technologies. We're obsessed with user experience, and the potential to create immersive software with natural, intuitive interaction has us very excited. We have quite a few VR devices in our office and have been working on internal prototypes to show off what we can create in a virtual world. Check out a video of a few of our developers demoing one of the scenes we are currently working on:</p>
<h2 class="highlight">Oculus Rift Demo</h2>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://player.vimeo.com/video/198053992' frameborder='0' webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>
<p>In this scene we are using custom models, textures, and particle effects created by our design team. We hooked up the sky and weather to match the conditions at your current location. The terrain is procedurally generated so the player will always have something new to look at. The first person controller was built by our developers and will soon be available for others to use on the Unity Asset Store. There is also ambient audio so users hear footsteps when walking or splashing when going into the water. The scene builds to a variety of different devices, and scales the graphics quality if the device isn't able to keep up without dropping the frame rate.</p>
<p>This is just one of the projects that we are working on using Virtual Reality, and we are looking forward to many more.</p>
<h2 class="highlight">Our Proven Impact</h2>
<p>Raizlabs has been playing with AR since 2012, when we built an app for <a href="https://www.raizlabs.com/blog/work/bloomingdales-2/">Bloomingdales</a> to bring their famous holiday windows in New York City to life. We were an early adopter of Google Glass and built a few prototypes with their SDK. We also hosted — and competed — in a Microsoft sponsored <a href="https://www.meetup.com/BostonAR/events/231023831/">hackathon</a> for their Augmented Reality product, HoloLens as well as a Google VR hackathon.</p>
<h2 class="highlight">The Future of Virtual Reality</h2>
<p>Our goal at Raizlabs is to improve lives through technology. We believe that Augmented and Virtual Reality can improve lives and have may have just as large of an impact as the original iPhone.
