<h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
<p>We help you grow your startup through a combination of office space, strategy, design, and development services as well as mentorship in company development and all things mobile. You’ll sit alongside our team of developers, designers, product managers, marketers, and business developers for four months right in the heart of downtown Boston while we help you create and ship great software.</p>
<h3>OUR EXPERTISE</h3>
<p>All things mobile and web. Our experience is in designing and building consumer facing products, apps, and web technologies. We have experience working with a range of technologies in mobile from fitness tech, BTLE, e-commerce, medical apps, social networks and more. Our team has a proven track record and over the past decade has developed technologies across iOS and Android with a focus on excellence in mobile-first user experience.</p>
<h3>Why Raizlabs?</h3>
<p>Our entire business is designing and building mobile apps. Since the early days of the App Store, we have launched hundreds of mobile apps. Raizlabs has worked with numerous startups, and established Fortune 500 companies. We’ve built <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/work/">some of the most successful apps in the world</a>.</p>
<p>Our team has identified a number of tools, techniques, and processes that significantly improve the odds that a company will have a great product and a successful launch. Our relationships with mobile leaders at companies including Apple and Google enable us to take advantage of opportunities in the mobile marketplace while getting you noticed in the crowd.</p>
<h3>We Focus on THE PRODUCT</h3>
<p>Unlike many other accelerators or startup incubation programs, our core expertise is building great products through technology and design. We will help you focus on your customer needs and use the right tools to help you get there faster.</p>
<p>We will push your product design further, we will push your technology toward excellence, and we'll help you build something special.</p>
<h3>Acceptance Criteria</h3>
<p>Our selection criteria is anchored more on people than anything else. We seek companies that would be a cultural fit and who share our vision for impactful software. Ideal teams will be early stage with 2-5 people, with a clear vision of their product, and a passionate team. We will select teams that are in non-competing spaces and markets. Each team in the cohort will also provide a good complement to the other teams (you will connect and learn from each other).</p>
