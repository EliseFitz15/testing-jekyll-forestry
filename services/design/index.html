<h1 class="highlight">Design is more than making things pretty</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Mobile design is more than looks, it's how things work. Our design process ensures that we are designing things that people want and need. We partner with companies to ensure that the final design isn't just visually attractive but also usable, functional and most importantly driving business results.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Understanding</strong><br />
We seek first to understand. Every story sets the stage for design and the first part is listening and trying to understand the need, both for users &amp; customers.</li>
<li><strong>Ideation &amp; Exploration</strong><br />
We explore, we play, we discover. It isn't about the first idea or our ideas, but the best idea. We work collaboratively with our clients to make sure to explore the problem space. The process is highly interactive, we have walls and walls of whiteboards to prove it. We draw, sketch and create to ensure we've uncovered the best ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Wireframes and Design Validation<br />
</strong>We use a  technique of storyboarding, wireframing and testing our designs. Even the best designs need to be validated, we use a collection of tools to ensure that designs work for real users.  The design process ensures that we're constantly getting better and using our learnings to inform further design iterations.</li>
<li><strong>Introspection &amp; Iteration<br />
</strong>Design is an iterative discipline. We design, build and observe. Great design is the design that ships. Our process ensures that design stays in the process until the application ships. This gives us accountability for the end-user-experience.</li>
</ol>
<p>Design inspires and informs every engineering decision. After the design is approved our work isn't complete. We work with our engineers to ensure the application implementation meets our design vision.</p>
<p>This is something you won't see other companies doing. We believe that design &amp; engineering must work together to produce superior products.</p>
