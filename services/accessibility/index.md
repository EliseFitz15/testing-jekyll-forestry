<h1 class="highlight">Accessibility</h1>
<p>Great design is about giving users great experiences. To design a great product, you need to understand how users will interact with that product. When designing for people with disabilities, accessibility comes naturally from good design. One of our greatest passions is solving unique problems that people with disabilities encounter every day. We are particularly proud of the positive impact these products have on people’s lives.</p>
<h1 class="highlight">Beyond the Visuals</h1>
<p>People often assume that design refers to the visual aspects of a product. However, some projects require the prioritization of non-visual design. Several of Raizlabs’ projects were built to accommodate users with obstructed or impaired vision.</p>
<p>Raizlabs worked with Perkins School for the Blind to help people catch their buses. When you have low vision, finding a bus stop can be a chore. Google Maps will bring you pretty close, but GPSs aren’t always that accurate. If you’re not within a few feet of the sign, the bus will pass you by. Google gave Perkins School for the Blind a $500,000 grant to find a solution to this problem. Perkins worked with Raizlabs to create BlindWays, an app that crowdsources tips and clues about the landmarks that surround bus stops in Greater Boston. BlindWays is designed to be easy to use for everyone, regardless of their vision. Everyone can chip in clues and get up-to-date bus schedules. If you’re in the Greater Boston area, get <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blindways-bus-stop-navigation/id1146615175?mt=8">BlindWays from the App Store</a> and submit some clues!</p>
<p>We strive to make accessibility-minded development more ...<em>accessible</em>. With that goal in mind, we internally developed <a href="https://github.com/Raizlabs/BonMot">BonMot</a>, an iOS library that makes dynamic type a cinch.</p>
<h1 class="highlight">Building for Government and Education</h1>
<p>Raizlabs worked with Skillsoft to build an iPhone app that would access Skillsoft’s massive library of training books, courses, videos, and audio. Skillsoft serves over 10,000 organizations, including governmental agencies and educational institutions. To comply with Section 508 regulations, Skillsoft needed a fully accessible app. Our team built an app that was fully navigable using the built-in accessibility features on iOS.</p>
<h1 class="highlight">Designing for Limited Movement</h1>
<p>Raizlabs has worked on a few apps where the UI had to accommodate users with limited movement. These apps required a different approach to touch screen interaction.</p>
<p>Hospital patients recovering from procedures will oftentimes have limited speech and movement. Patient Voice asked Raizlabs to build an iPad app to help recovering patients communicate. The Patient Voice app let patients communicate with their nurses via a dashboard of pre-written messages, look through medical records, make housekeeping requests, and access in-hospital entertainment. Raizlabs’ team designed the Patient Voice app with large text, buttons, icons, and images so that patients with limited movement could operate the app more easily. Raizlabs’ attention to user experience made the Patient Voice app a boon for hospitals and patients alike.</p>
<p>Raizlabs also worked with NxStage, the create of the world’s only at-home hemodialysis machine, to develop Nx2me. Our tablet solution was designed for one-handed use (the other arm being connected to a dialysis machine) and enabled live visibility into blood pressures, flow and system function.  The dashboard replaced a 15-pound instruction binder.</p>
<h1 class="highlight">Accessibility Through Great Design</h1>
<p>Raizlabs is committed to building fantastic user experiences. We can only uphold that commitment by understanding who is using our products and how they are using them. We are excited about building accessible apps because of the user experience challenges they pose and we look forward to facing more of these challenges in the future.<br />
