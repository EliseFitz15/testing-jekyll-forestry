<h1 class="highlight">Mapping Solutions</h1>
<p>When GPS was first rumored to be added to the iPhone back in 2008, Raizlabs predicted the enormous impact of personalized mapping and routing. We took a calculated risk and developed RunKeeper — one of the first iPhone apps — and today, over 50 million users exercise with it. Since then, we’ve continued to innovate at the forefront of the industry, delivering transformative geolocation solutions.</p>
<h2 class="highlight">Mobile Geolocation Capabilities</h2>
<p>We have industry-leading experience building and enhancing mobile products with diverse mapping capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Locations </strong><span style="color: #808080">—</span>  <span style="color: #808080">We can display and cluster event, store, attraction, and item locations enabling users to filter, sort, discover, navigate, and explore.</span></li>
<li><strong>Geofencing </strong><span style="color: #808080">— </span> <span style="color: #808080">No need to check in. We can automatically provide users with location-relevant content and functionality.</span></li>
<li><strong>Custom Map Tiles </strong><span style="color: #808080">—</span>  <span style="color: #808080">We can replace satellite imagery with custom artwork to provide a more inviting, informative and concentrated wayfinding and discovery experience.</span></li>
<li><strong>Custom Routing </strong><span style="color: #808080">— </span><strong> </strong><span style="color: #808080">We can define custom navigable paths and destinations to enable wayfinding indoors, outdoors, in parks, in oceans; Wherever.</span></li>
<li><strong>Tracking </strong><span style="color: #808080">—</span><strong>  </strong><span style="color: #808080">Track a workout, share a location with loved ones, send an ETA.</span></li>
<li><strong>Battery Life </strong><span style="color: #808080">—  </span><span style="color: #808080">We’ll throttle GPS usage alongside activity to limit battery consumption.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="highlight">Our Proven Impact</h2>
<p>We believe in improving lives through technology and design. We love being on the leading edge of technology and solving difficult problems for our clients.</p>
<h4>We put MIT’s academic buildings on the map<em>– before that was possible.</em></h4>
<p>By reimplementing MapKit to consume a custom GIS backend, we enabled MIT to be among the first universities with an interactive campus map and real time shuttle tracking.</p>
<h4>We brought Six Flags’ illustrated park maps to life.</h4>
<p>Preserving the familiar and approachable perspective of the paper maps, we combined GPS functionality with custom map tiles to immerse users in a branded experience. We enabled micro-navigation within the park by converting hand-drawn paths on satellite imagery into walkable vector routes. Today, hundreds of thousands of users can filter by thrill-level, find the shortest wait time, and navigate via the fastest route.</p>
<h4>We added indoor navigation to Macy’s<em>– </em>before iBeacons existed</h4>
<p>We leveraged wifi triangulation to add micronavigation to Macy's flagship Herald Square location. We've additionally enabled indoor interactive mapping for Bloomingdales and SolidWorks. Our hack projects include an indoor Augmented Reality wayfinder for Hololens.</p>
<h2 class="highlight">Put Your Product on the Map</h2>
<p>Does your next product involve mapping, routing, or geolocation? Worried it’s impossible? Don’t worry; We’ve been there, done that. Let us know where you’re trying to go and we’ll help you get there.</p>
