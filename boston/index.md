<h1>BOSTON MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT FIRM</h1>
<p>Raizlabs is a leading Boston mobile app development company. We’ve been building mobile apps for local companies from the beginning. We’re involved in the local community including <a href="http://www.momoboston.com/">Mobile Monday</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/massmobile/">MassMobile</a>, <a title="WebInno - Web Innovators Group" href="http://webinnovatorsgroup.com/">WebInno</a>, and even founded our own local mobile meetup called “<a title="DrinksOnTap" href="http://drinksdontap.org">DrinksOnTap</a>.”</p>
<p>Our process covers the entire lifecycle of designing, developing, and deploying an application to the Apple App Store or Google Play Market. We have had top-selling applications in the Utilities, Finance, Music and Fitness categories, among many others.</p>
<p>We have a long history of building quality applications that win awards. In 2009, Time Magazine named one of our apps the top 10 of the year.</p>
<h2>Boston Recognition</h2>

Raizlabs is known as innovators in Boston &amp; the New England area. We've been recognized as a leading company by the Boston Globe, Boston Business Journal, Harvard University, MIT and other local and regional groups.</p>
<p>We also help direct the Boston app developer community by organizing, participating and speaking at local and national technology events.</p>
<h2>How are we Different?</h2>
<ul>
<li>We are the only local firm that provides full-service mobile application strategy, design and development onshore. We do this because we believe in quality.</li>
<li>We focus on native application development because we want to deliver a truly great user experience.</li>
<li>Our company has the best track record in the region for launching successful mobile applications. Our apps consistently rank high with customers and in the app store.</li>
</ul>
<p>We started in Boston but we'll work with to bring your product to the world.</p>
