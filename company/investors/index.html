<h1 class="highlight">A bit about our Company</h1>
<p>Raizlabs is a self-funded Massachusetts S-Corporation that has been profitable since our founding 10 years ago in 2003. We have strong relationships with many national venture firms and have built mobile product and applications for the portfolio companies managed by: Matrix Partners, Raptor Ventures, Charles River Ventures, Flybridge Capital, Highland Capital, North Bridge Ventures, General Catalyst among others.</p>
<p>We provide several core services for serious investors:</p>
<p><strong>Advisory roles and mobile consultations</strong> - Technology moves fast, we move faster. We provide advisory roles to many investors evaluating concepts, ideas and technologies. If you are evaluating a mobile company and need to vet either the mobile team or the strength of their technology we can provide a analysis and recommendations based on long history of successful mobile products.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile team</strong> - We've worked with a number of early stage investors as they help their portfolio companies get products to market faster at a higher level of quality. This can range from a full engagement to helping founders and CEO's structure their companies for mobile success.</p>
<h2>We love great companies</h2>
