<h1>What are Hack Days?</h1>
<p>We have a culture of creating new things and part of that is playing with technology. Many of us got into software because we love building things and playing with the latest and greatest computers, gadgets, phones and technologies.</p>
<p>Hack days occur every other Friday and it is up to each individual to set aside time to make something or learn something. On an annual basis it's like getting an extra month dedicated to innovation.</p>
<p>Hack day events occur every two weeks and provide a format for people to explore, create and discover. Hack day allows us to incubate our own technology, tools and apps. We encourage teamwork however it's not required. What is required is at the end of the day you demo or present what you learned.</p>
<p>During Hack Day we try hard not to schedule meetings, interviews or other interruptions. We are public about Hack Days, we want our clients to know that the innovation &amp; discovery contribute to every project we take on.</p>
<h1>WHAT Types of Things Come out of Hackday?</h1>
<p>A wide range of technology, tools and inspirations have come from Hack Day. In-office tools, experiments, new iOS technology, techniques, 3D game experiments and augmented reality, kiosk applications, open source components, office designs, integration with various 3rd party technologies as well as a host of pranks on people's desks.</p>
<p>Not all hack-day projects "Ship." Some are useless however as a whole we're able to produce more technical exploration, learning and discovery in a day then many companies produce in a year.</p>
<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>As you go into a professional role you can sometimes lose track of the fact that the work you got into can become less enjoyable. Nobel prize winning physicist Richard Feyman said it well:</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p>"...Physics disgusts me a little bit now, but I used to <i>enjoy</i> doing physics. Why did I enjoy it? I used to <i>play</i> with it. I used to do whatever I felt like doing - it didn't have to do with whether it was important for the development of nuclear physics...  I started to play with physics... It was like uncorking a bottle: Everything flowed out effortlessly,"<br />
- Richard Feynman (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=7papZR4oVssC&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;ots=esU2efsNZY&amp;dq=but%20I%20used%20to%20enjoy%20doing%20physics.%20Why%20did%20I%20enjoy%20it%3F%20I%20used%20to%20play%20with%20it.&amp;pg=PA173#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Surely You're Joking Mr Feynman</a>)</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>We believe that play leads to innovation, creation, energy and productivity. You can't force innovation, but you can create opportunities where innovation is a byproduct of play.</p>
<p>We could tell you more... but first you need to join us.<br />
