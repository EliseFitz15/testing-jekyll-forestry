<h2>We trust you with more than <span class="highlight">Vacation</span></h2>
<p>Raizlabs is not a typical company and when we thought about our vacation policy we wanted to take a trust based approach. We expect our team to do great work, we expect people to make an impact and to shape the world through great software. That's pretty important stuff.</p>
<p>The point of policies is to make it easier to grow the company and the easiest way to do that is to trust that our team will get there together.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5">If we trust our people with the important stuff, so why not trust them with their own time off? Therefore, our philosophy on time off is to trust our employees. We're building great software and a great company and we believe that life balance is important in doing so:<br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone is expected to take a break. There are designated company holidays and even a time off minimum.</li>
<li>We have a team based approach to vacation. You don't have to get a manager to approve time off but you need to make sure your teams have what they need.</li>
<li>How much time off you take is up to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our policy can be summed up:</p>
<h2>IN TEAM WE TRUST.</h2>
<p>This applies to all personal time off, including holidays and sick days.  We anticipate that most people will prefer to take time off during traditional holidays, but that isn’t a requirement.  Take time as you need it. If you are sick, take the time to get healthy. If you're on vacation, enjoy your time away. Afterwards, come back and help us build great software and change the world.</p>
