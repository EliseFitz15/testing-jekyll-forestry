<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5587" src="http://www.raizlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/polaroid_coffee_sm.png" alt="Coffee Shop Development" width="442" height="501" />Gregory Raiz <a title="History" href="http://www.raizlabs.com/company/history/">founded the company in 2003</a>. A former project manager for Microsoft’s Windows XP team, Greg wanted to shape the world through a greater personal impact on software and technology.</p>
<p>Initially, Raizlabs worked with companies around New England, helping them improve their user interface and user experience design. However, it soon became clear that design and development needed to work more closely together in order to deliver better software. In 2005, Raizlabs hired its first developer to help ensure that design vision and implementation were well aligned. The app development company moved into a small office in Coolidge Corner.</p>
<p>Raizlabs had already started to experiment with mobile when Apple announced the first iPhone in 2008. The company was in the ideal position to launch some of the very first apps into the App Store, including RunKeeper—now with more than 40 million users worldwide.</p>
<p>More than 100 launches later, the company outgrew its Coolidge Corner roots and relocated to downtown Boston in December 2012, followed shortly by an expansion to San Francisco in 2013.</p>
