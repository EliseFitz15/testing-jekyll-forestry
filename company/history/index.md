<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<p>The company was founded in 2003 in by Gregory Raiz. We started small in a Starbucks in Brookline's Coolidge Corner. Raizlabs vision is to make software better. Over time that vision has evolved to be impactful in improving lives through technology and design.</p>
<p>Prior to starting Raizlabs, Greg had been a PM (Project Manager) at Microsoft on the Windows team. After leaving Seattle Greg wanted to focus on having a greater personal impact on design, software, and technology.</p>
<p>The initial focus of the company was to make better software. Initially, the company worked on user interface and user experience design. We worked with many New England companies to explore their applications, understand their technology and then design changes and recommendations. After several years a pattern began to emerge:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We would hand designs to the client and check back in a few months. Every time, the design diverged. I knew we needed a new approach.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Design + <span class="highlight">Development</span></h2>
<p>In exploring the pairing between design and development it became clear that the two needed to work closer together in order to deliver better software. In 2005 Raizlabs hired it's first developer to help ensure that design vision and implementation were well aligned.  With that move the company moved into a small two person office in the Coolidge Corner location.</p>

<p>In 2008 when Apple announced the iPhone Raizlabs had already started to experiment with mobile. The timing was right and the company was able to launch some of the <a title="RunKeeper" href="/work/runkeeper/">very first apps</a> into the app store.</p>
<p>The company outgrew it's Coolidge Corner roots and in December of 2012 relocated to downtown <a title="Boston Mobile Development" href="/boston/">Boston</a>. Fueled by demand for mobile expertise and quality products the company continued to grow, opening an office in San Francisco in 2013.</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>Our history shows us the past but is also a mirror into the future. We continue on the quest to make better software, both for ourselves and for the future.</p>
