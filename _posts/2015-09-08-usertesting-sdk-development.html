<h1>Taking Usertesting to the next level</h1>
<p>UserTesting, the leader in software usability testing, already had an extremely successful business analyzing the usability of thousands of well-known websites. When companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft want to find out what real-world users think of their sites and how well they use them, they turn to UserTesting.</p>
<p>With a successful and growing core business of over 30,000 customers, UserTesting knew that the future of technology did not simply consist of websites. UserTesting began work to validate product-market fit for mobile usability testing with an over-the-shoulder camera apparatus. In forward-thinking fashion, UserTesting partnered with Raizlabs to devise a new, software-only usability testing solution for mobile apps instead of traditional and more costly over-the-shoulder cameras.<br />

<h1>Powerful SDK Development</h1>
<p>Raizlabs developed a cutting-edge software development kit (SDK) that UserTesting can automatically integrate into mobile apps to record testers’ interactions without any interruption to the user’s experience.</p>
<p>Once UserTesting's SDK project was kicked off, Raizlabs researched and developed an SDK that enables HD video, sound recording, and gesture visualization of mobile testers using apps—straight from their devices.</p>
<p>This presented a myriad of technical challenges that the Raizlabs team overcame through engineering ingenuity and an efficient use of device resources. With our extensive knowledge of iOS, we were able to achieve several technical breakthroughs utilizing APIs in ways that had never been done before.</p>

<h1>the results</h1>
<p>As a result of Raizlabs' problem solving, UserTesting was first to market with an <a href="http://www.usertesting.com/product/mobile-application-testing">SDK allowing for end-to-end usability testing on mobile</a>. With this new solution, companies around the world are able to perform usability tests on their mobile apps and see same-day test results from testers that meet any variety of demographic requirements. UserTesting's growing and diverse tester population wouldn't have been possible with their over-the-shoulder camera apparatus.</p>
<blockquote><p>"We're very pleased with our partnership with Raizlabs. Their attention to detail in UX and their creativity at resolving tough technical problems set them apart from many other development companies."<br />

<p>UserTesting went on to raise $45.5 million in a new round of funding led by Accel Partners, a venture capital firm that was one of Facebook’s earliest backers. UserTesting used the injection of cash to build out their new mobile usability business while ramping up hiring and operations across their entire organization.<br />
