<p>We are excited to announce that we’ve completed the acquisition of <a href="http://findandform.com/">Find &amp; Form</a>, a Boston-based mobile app design and development agency. Find &amp; Form’s clients included the popular wine app <a href="https://www.drync.com/">Drync</a>, Boston startup <a href="http://www.shuttersong.com/">Shuttersong</a>, and a startup called The Collective which was founded by the CEO of StumbleUpon. We’ve been working with Find &amp; Form over the last few months on a number of projects and we felt that the partnership could be extended and deepened through a strategic acquisition.</p>
<p>Both Raizlabs and Find &amp; Form share a passion for excellence in digital products and mobile technology. The partners of Find &amp; Form represent the core pillars of Raizlabs’ values. We believe that these elements are core to building and engineering great products: <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/services/">Mobile Strategy, Product Design, and Software Development</a>. These elements have been central to both companies' successes, and will continue to be central to our joint ability to create and build great digital products in the future.</p>
<p>We have experienced incredible growth over the last few years, and our first acquisition brings another major growth milestone. Raizlabs is an <a href="http://www.inc.com/inc5000/index.html">Inc 5000 company</a> and a Boston Business Journal Pacesetter. We have been growing as a technology leader in the greater Boston area, and our San Francisco Bay area office has also been growing at a rapid pace since opening in early 2014. Additionally, our <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/2015/02/raizlabs-launches-startup-incubator/">startup incubator started last month</a> and we're hosting 7 startups as part of the program. The acquisition of Find &amp; Form will further expand our capabilities and allow us to continue to take on innovative and exciting projects for startups and Fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p>Founder &amp; CEO of Raizlabs, Gregory Raiz, had this to say: “We’ve explored acquisitions in the past, but this was the first time that things really lined up in terms of culture and capabilities. It was critical for us that the joint effort would be a win-win for everyone involved.”</p>
<p>“Find &amp; Form has been approached before for possible acquisitions, but the opportunities didn’t really feel right.” said Dave Wigder, former CEO of Find &amp; Form. “We had the opportunity to collaborate on a project with Raizlabs, and immediately noticed how aligned we actually were from a product to a culture perspective.”</p>
<p>Find &amp; Form’s partners co-founded and helped grow Find &amp; Form from 3 to 23 across the US and overseas. Find &amp; Form’s offices will move to Raizlabs’ brand new 17,000 square foot headquarters in downtown Boston. Four Find &amp; Form employees will join Raizlabs as full time employees, including the company’s three founding partners.</p>
<p>The acquisition brings us expanded capabilities in product strategy, design, development, and product management. Darion Miller, Jon Lopkin, and Jenny Miller will join Raizlabs’ Engineering, Design, and Product teams respectively.</p>
<p>Existing clients of both companies can expect to have access to a greater pool of resources and capabilities. The joint team will have a greater depth across native mobile app development, web service development, and design capabilities. The acquisition also allows Raizlabs to provide better strategic mobile consulting services to companies looking to re-think their business organizations as mobile-focused.</p>
