<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Author and entreprenuer Nir Eyal kicked off </span><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://habitsummit.com" target="_blank">Habit Summit</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> by reminding us why we care about hooking our users on the products we’re building:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>They have a higher lifetime value.</li>
<li>They allow for greater flexibility in price.</li>
<li>They help supercharge growth.</li>
<li>They increase defensibility against competitors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stories around the Hooked Model:</h2>
<p>It didn't take long for <a href="http://www.nirandfar.com">Eyal</a> to dive into case studies and behavioral psychology that established the Hooked Model, identifying the key ingredients for the habit building recipe: triggers, action, variable reward and investment.</p>
<p>Many Habit Summit speakers tied their experiences and learnings to the Hooked Model. Here are some takeaways:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6579" alt="hooked" src="http://www.raizlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-26-at-8.36.07-AM-1024x512.png" width="756" height="378" /></p>
<h3>1. Where’s the <span style="color: #eb574b;">trigger</span>? External triggers are easy. Internal triggers are sticky:</h3>
<h4>Trigger: Every habit-forming product requires a mechanism to prime a user to complete the<i> </i>desired action.</h4>
<p>Marketing teams often focus narrowly on external triggers without realizing the opportunity of deeper mental associations. External triggers are familiar and include traditional advertisements as well as modern mediums such as push notifications, mobile reminders and emails. External triggers are especially useful in the early stages of building a habit, but they rarely have the lasting impact of internal triggers.</p>
<p>Eyal outlined a few examples of internal triggers:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we feel lonely, we use Facebook.</li>
<li>When we feel unsure, we use Google.</li>
<li>When we feel bored, we use YouTube.</li>
</ul>
<p>Internal triggers are associations in the mind between feelings and products, and negative emotions can be particularly powerful internal triggers. Eyal explained the importance of considering your customer's internal triggers when designing a product.</p>
<p>For example, what feeling will remind your users to look for your icon on their home screen?</p>
<h3>2. Defining the <span style="color: #eb574b;">action</span>: The “Twitter Inception”</h3>
<h4>Action<b>: </b>The desired action can be as simple as scrolling through Pinterest or as difficult as logging a ten mile run.</h4>
<p>Product Guy <a href="https://twitter.com/joshelman">Josh Elman</a> has a successful track record of designing habit-forming products. In his presentation, Elman explained his methodology behind reinventing Twitter. He explained that by redefining and redesigning the onboarding process, Elman helped turn Twitter into the habit-forming product it is today.</p>
<p>When Elman joined, Twitter was positioned as the product that helped friends keep in touch with each other — but plenty of technology products had this same promise. After internal retrospection, user feedback sessions and data mining, Elman helped the Twitter team discover its value as "the product that helped its users know what’s going on in their world."</p>
<p>Rather than focusing on connecting with friends and broadcasting, Elman redesigned the onboarding process to train users to follow people and topics of interest. Elman described how the Twitter team primed their users to take the action that matched the behavior they wanted to create. In doing so, Twitter users learned to follow other users and discover the benefit of understanding what’s going on in the world with the people they care about.</p>
<h3>3. <span style="color: #eb574b;">Variable rewards</span>, and the risk of high expectations:</h3>
<h4>Variable Reward:<b> </b>Users will only be primed to complete an action if there is an anticipation of reward.</h4>
<p>We’ve learned that sticky products don’t end up that way by chance. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">The expectation of </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">variable</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">reward</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> introduces a level of stress to the brain that can only be relieved by scratching the proverbial itch.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Matthew Pearson, Data Maven at Airbnb, explained some of the consequences that can arise when discrepancies occur between the expectation of reward and the reward itself.</span></p>
<p>One of Pearson's most interesting anecdotes from data mining at Airbnb included the link between weather and ratings. Pearson explained how reservations that were otherwise equal, but took place during more favorable than average weather conditions, produced significantly higher ratings. Likewise, reservations that took place during less favorable than average weather conditions produced significantly lower ratings.</p>
<p>Pearson discussed the importance in understanding that customers will never think about rewards in absolute terms. Rather, rewards are always relative to an anchor point.</p>
<p>For example, when I plan a trip to Hawaii, my expectations might include hot, sunny days on the beach. If the weather ended up being cool and rainy, I would be considerably less happy than I am now as I write this post on a cool rainy day in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Though weather is outside of Airbnb's control, understanding the link between expectation and satisfaction will help the company understand how to optimize for satisfaction in areas that are inside their control.</p>
<h3>4. Optimizing products for the right <span style="color: #eb574b;">investments</span></h3>
<h4>Investment: Stored value in a product that should be designed to load the next trigger.</h4>
<p>In the Hooked Model, we learn that products tend to be more sticky when a user invests their time and energy. People tend to overvalue their investments, and when designed with intent, investments help to load the next trigger for future engagement. For instance, Facebook users with more friends (the investment), have a higher likelihood of receiving notifications (the trigger). Another example would be Runkeeper. Runkeeper users with a log of fitness data (the investment), are more likely to perpetuate their habit when they feel like exercising (the trigger).<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>Jeff Atwood, founder of Stack Overflow, explained his process for designing investments in the Stack Overflow community around certain intended behaviors. He believes that finding answers on Stack Overflow is the reward, but contributing to the community is the investment.</p>
<p>Stack Overflow users store value in the system with their contributions, and Atwood's design for the reputation system provided incentives to benefit the developer community. Users tied their metrics on Stack Overflow to their real world reputations. Atwood explained that his careful implementation of investments into the system motivated users to ask questions, vote and contribute to the developer community with valuable answers.</p>
<h2>Summary: Design for habits with intent</h2>
<p>It would be impossible to summarize Habit Summit in a couple of paragraphs, but it is safe to say that the stories shared around failures and successes of habit design helped reinforce the Hooked Model.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for your product?</p>
<p>Habit design starts at the outset. Designers and developers should be mindful about identifying the behavior they're trying to create earlier rather than later. If implemented correctly, products focused on integrating triggers, simple actions, variable rewards and investment, should have a higher likelihood of building habits that sustain user growth.</p>
