<li>They wanted apps that have been featured by Google. Check.</li>
<li>They wanted apps that have over a million downloads. Yep.</li>
<li>They wanted apps that have 4.5 stars or higher. That, too.</li>

<li>They wanted to see Nanodegree participation and Android community involvement.</li>
<li>And much more.</li>
</ul>
