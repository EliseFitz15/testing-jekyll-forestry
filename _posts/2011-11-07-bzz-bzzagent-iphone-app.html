The application is tied into the core BzzAgent business. It instantly allows their existing agents to harvest photographs. This was previously possible, but the nature of mobile photos makes this much easier. You no longer have to download the photos from your camera to your computer and then upload them. Everything is one step.</p>
<p>Mobile applications are about capturing the moment.  The ability to spontaneously share a brand moment allowed BzzAgent users to share their experiences as they happen, instead of waiting until they are back at their computers.</p>
<p>In the days after the app launch BzzAgent quickly saw photos and reports pouring in. The team is now exploring how to take this success further both in terms of platforms and impact.</p>
