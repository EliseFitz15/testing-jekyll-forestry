<ol>
<li>Always deliver a great product.  Work with the design and development teams on building a great product.  Don’t settle for something you wouldn’t ship for your own company.</li>
</ol>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Build up a repertoire of your own mobile specific insights and also gather vetted insights from your peers.  It’s not about how brilliant you are, it’s how brilliant we are.</li>
</ol>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>If you are new at something and not feeling a ton of confidence in whatever it may be, prepare until you feel ok and then go for it.</li>
</ol>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Bugs are never emergencies.  Some just need fixing faster than others.</li>
</ol>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Download a few apps almost every day.  Choose apps from every category and note anytime you see something special.  Understand the root of what makes a specific capability or specific piece of functionality special.</li>
</ol>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>When overwhelmed, focus on where things: A) show the most promise and B) pose the greatest threat.</li>
</ol>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Less is most often more in mobile design.  Make sure you have a compelling argument against using tons of features in your app.</li>
</ol>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>In software, things are always going to go wrong eventually, however when they do, strong relationships matter.  Build them.</li>
</ol>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Read Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines as well as Google’s User Interface Guidelines.  When people ask for features or functionality that violate these, be sure to softly call this out if you need to.  Cite third parties when calling out something as wrong as much as you can and don’t make it personal.  Make it about getting to the best design.</li>
</ol>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Respect the engineers, always respect the engineers.</li>
</ol>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Process is a big problem when the team is more focused on the process rather than the objective of the process.</li>
</ol>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<ol start="12">
<li>If you don’t write code, you still need to understand the software development process and how software applications are built to as to prevent problems, assure quality and work with estimates.</li>
</ol>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Don’t act omnipotent!  If you are not sure about something, just be responsive and say, "I’m not exactly sure" or "I don’t know" or "let me check with the design or dev team."</li>
</ol>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Be flexible.  If a team lives by a specific bug tracking tool or something else they need, go ahead adopt as long as it doesn’t interfere with results.</li>
</ol>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<ol start="15">
<li>Take charge of projects early.  Fail to and others will fill the void if they don’t feel things are being run as needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over and out.</p>
