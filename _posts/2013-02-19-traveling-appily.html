  San Francisco -  the city I had never been to but had heard much about. A road trip to the "Fog City" was supposed to have happened after my recent graduation but never materialized. So, I marked a date on my calendar and said to myself that this time, I would get there.

  Knowing that most airlines these days charge extra for checked bags, traveling light was how I would have to go. That meant there wasn’t much space to fit anything besides clothes and the basic necessities. I decided then and there that there would be no need to carry any electronics besides my iPhone... which is where this journey began.

<a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/2013/02/traveling-appily/travel_2/" rel="attachment wp-att-4704"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4704" alt="travel_2" src="http://www.raizlabs.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/travel_2.png" width="620" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Cross country trips usually start with plane tickets. Normally, this would be a long process that involves web surfing and research, but <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skyscanner-all-flights-everywhere!/id415458524?mt=8" target="_blank"><b>Skyscanner</b></a> managed to score me some very decently priced tickets with just a few taps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of individually opening Travelocity, Expedia, Priceline, Kayak, and a host of others, Skyscanner compares the airfare prices from all of these sites and gives you the best prices for the searched flight in a neat bar graph that shows the day of the month on the horizontal axis and the price on the vertical axis. Check which days are cheaper or save some dollars by flying out in the morning rather than mid-day thanks to once glance at Skyscanner's bar graph. Feeling up for a last minute trip to England to catch a soccer match? Tap the “Explore” button to see the cheapest flights to different parts of the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once I landed in the Frisco Bay, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/san-francisco-exploration/id312912653?mt=8" target="_blank"><b>San Francisco Exploration Guide</b></a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/top-25-san-francisco-attractions/id428173872?mt=8" target="_blank"><b>Top 25 San Francisco Attractions Guide </b></a>helped me get around the city like a local. The Exploration Guide presents an inside scoop on the best places to visit based on the author’s personal experiences. The content is written in a casual and inviting tone, which is refreshing when you’re trying to gauge how engaging a tourist site actually is. The app helped me find the San Francisco Museum of Modern Arts, a must-see for contemporary art enthusiasts. Highly recommended!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Top 25 San Francisco Attractions Guide has nice maps that locate where each tourist spot is and also includes a "Free when?" section that lets you know when the attraction is free to visit. I explored the Asian Art Museum for free after poking around this app and found things to do around the museum from its map.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/transporter-real-time-public/id373726282?mt=8" target="_blank">Transporter</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-transit-app/id498151501?mt=8" target="_blank">Transit</a> </b>and <b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/embark-ibart-san-francisco/id288656960?mt=8" target="_blank">Embark iBART</a> </b>got me from point A to point B before Google released their native iOS maps app. Transporter has a nice, easy-to-use interface that includes a countdown for the next bus’s arrival time for the stations closest to you. I used it to figure out that the bus would take too long to reach me the morning of my 5k road race, which resulted in me running (uphill) about 7k to reach the starting point. If only I had woken up earlier, the app might have helped me out a bit more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Embark shows you how to get places using the BART system. If your destination is far away from their routes, then this is not the best way to go. Once you've memorized the structure of the train lines, the app becomes less helpful. All transit systems seem easier after you’ve experience Boston’s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Transit app is a comprehensive mapping app that includes live bus and train route information. Transit is visually very interesting and feels fun to use. Unfortunately, it provided less-than-convenient routes to Golden Gate Bridge, which resulted in me taking lots of wrong buses and doing more walking in the rain than I had hoped. Having said that, you are more likely to have success with this app if you are already accustomed to the city’s bus system.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/2013/02/traveling-appily/travel_3/" rel="attachment wp-att-4705"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4705" alt="travel_3" src="http://www.raizlabs.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/travel_3.png" width="620" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Being San Francisco, it rained during much of the trip. Luckily, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weather-on-push-notification/id554438153?mt=8" target="_blank"><b>Weather On</b></a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/myradar-weather-radar/id322439990?mt=8" target="_blank"><b>MyRadar</b></a> helped me figure out when I was going to need my raincoat (which turned out to be “always”). Weather On is not free, but it's accurate, features some delicious animations and shows the forecasted temperatures as a bar graph, which makes visualizing the progression of increasing or decreasing temperatures much easier. Use MyRadar when the forecast is predicting rain and there are no clouds in sight. One glance at the map tells you how far away and intense the approaching precipitation will be. Hopefully your vacations aren’t as rainy so that you won’t have to use these apps often, but they’re helpful all the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At one point during the trip when I was appointed the restaurant-picker for my friends who lived there (Why me? I know.) I ended up going back to the trusty <b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/urbanspoon/id284708449?mt=8" target="_blank">Urbanspoon</a> </b>app<b> </b>to discover some dining options around me that were affordable and delicious. Just so you know, The Crepe House on Valencia St. is amazing... for future reference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I finally got to experience what  this great city was about, and I was able to do it with ease because of the apps that I had on my smartphone.  Spending less time wondering things like "When is the train going to come?" or "When is the museum open?" allowed me to remain in my comfort zone and really enjoy my visit. Usually, I have to plan everything out in advance so that I don’t get lost or confused, but this experience was more free-flowing and impromptu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For people who want to travel this way themselves, make sure to download all the apps that you need ahead of time so that dodgy wifi/data connections aren’t affecting your trip. If you’re traveling to a foreign country where a different language is spoken, check out <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sayhi-translate/id437818260?mt=8" target="_blank"><b>SayHi</b></a>, which is an accurate two-way translation app. Also try <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/word-lens/id383463868?mt=8" target="_blank"><b>Word Lens</b></a>, which uses augmented reality technology to translate text from one language to another in real time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I won’t be using the same apps on my next trip to Charleston, South Carolina, especially the city guides and transportation apps. But I can’t wait to travel this way again.</p>
