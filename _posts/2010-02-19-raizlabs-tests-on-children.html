  <strong><em>New Mother Goose App Included Children of Company Founder, Animator in Its Design Process</em></strong>

  BOSTON, Massachusetts (February 19, 2010) - Raizlabs announces the release of Mother Goose Classic, its kid-tested, Apple-approved nursery rhyme application. Mother Goose Classic features interactive versions of nine beloved rhymes with original animation and music including Humpty Dumpty, Jack Be Nimble, Jack &amp; Jill, Hickory-Dickory-Dock, Little Miss Muffet, Mary Had a Little Lamb, Hey-Diddle-Diddle, This Little Piggy and Pat-A-Cake.

  The process wasn’t easy. Raizlabs developed its own technology to display interactive animation as part of a broader, designer-friendly content framework for the iPhone. The iPhone famously does not support Flash animation. “I’m really excited about this project, not only because I’m a dad and my daughter loves this app but because it opens up so many possibilities for interactive storytelling,” said Gregory Raiz, founder of Raizlabs.

Animator Dave Counts said “My son and I regularly visit kids’ sites together, but watching him respond to something I helped create was incredibly satisfying. I was working for him as much as I was working for Raizlabs.”</p>
