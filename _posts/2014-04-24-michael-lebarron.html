<p>Michael has been into technology and building website from the early years. His first job was at a local ISP in New Hampshire, back when we could sit and watch the modems and see people dial in. He hasn't looked back since.</p>
<p>After attending WPI, Michael stayed in MA, working in the Boston area. From early stage startups like CitySquares, RueLaLa and Gemvara, he's always pushing towards the vision of interconnected devices, and a great experience wherever you are and whatever device you're on.</p>
