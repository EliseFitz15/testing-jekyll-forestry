Raiz is the founder and CEO of (aptly named) Raizlabs, a Brookline, MA-based mobile development shop that started in 2003. The company is known for developing mobile apps and doing consulting and design work for a lot of startups and big companies, especially in the Boston area—RunKeeper (FitnessKeeper), Intuit, Rue La La, and Sermo, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/2011/08/appblade-com-released/">Raizlabs rolled out its first software-as-a-service offering, called AppBlade</a>. (The name is meant to connote a Swiss army knife.) The suite of tools helps developers distribute their apps to customers and helps them keep the apps secure and updated after crashes, as well as providing insights into how people are using the apps, among other things, Raiz says. The project grew out of 'gaps in the workflow' at Raizlabs, he says. The goal over the next six to 12 months is to transform it from a host of app-development tools into a 'robust platform,' Raiz says."</p>
