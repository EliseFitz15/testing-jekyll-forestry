  YORK (December 20, 2010) - Imagine a consumer being personally recognized and featured
  on a TV or billboard as they walk into New York's Penn Station.  That’s the concept
  that the creative team at CBS Outdoor came up with for their Intel smart TV campaign
  launch.  Once the concept was introduced, the next step was to find the mobile team
  that could make it happen. Their search led CBS Outdoor to Location Labs and Raizlabs

Their search led CBS Outdoor to Location Labs and Raizlabs who had previously partnered to develop the automated check-in app <a title="iTunes store" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mayor-maker/id390148464?mt=8" target="_blank">MayorMaker</a>.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-867"></a>Utilizing Location Labs geofencing technology that creates virtual boundaries by using physical locations - and recognizes when a user enters or leaves a designated area - Raizlabs built a customized smart TV Android app for this unique campaign. Participants entered the text "Hello" to 64444 in order to download the <a title="Android App" href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/intel-smart-tv/com.cbsoutdoor.smarttv" target="_blank">smart TV mobile application</a>.  As participants entered Penn Station, the application triggered the smart TV experience.</p>
<p>Gregory Raiz, founder of Raizlabs said, "Mobile phone technology is advancing quickly, experiences that would have been science fiction are now becoming a reality. We love building apps like this, it's like we're building the future."</p>
<p>Participants answered a few questions about their TV viewing habits and preferences after downloading the Intel Smart TV application to their Android device.  Based on the data collected, the interactive touchscreen displays recognized the participants by name and generated a customized smart TV experience as they entered Penn Station.</p>
<p>"This is a first for out-of-home media, and a look into the future on how we can connect to consumers on a far more personalized basis," said Jodi Senese, EVP/CBS Outdoor. "Never before have we been able to offer this kind of engagement, on this many platforms to our clients. Working with Intel, OMG, and Tribal, CBS Outdoor has crafted a truly unique promotion that offers users a one-of-a-kind experience."</p>
<p>Tasso Roumeliotis, founder and CEO, Location Labs suggested that while it was a first, it is also the future, "We anticipate these kinds of futuristic campaigns to revolutionize the advertising and marketing industry."</p>
