<h1>Move Over, Powerpoint</h1>
</div>
<p>Data storage giant EMC hosts over 10,000 information technology professionals at its annual EMC World conference. The company approached Raizlabs to find a way for their data storage sales team to roam the conference floor while illustrating to customers how EMC products fit within their existing infrastructure. This called for something far more sophisticated than a slideshow.</p>

<h2>Getting Results</h2>
<p>EMC BackUp Sketchpad turned a product catalog into an IT planning tool for prospective customers, converting leads into sales. Raizlabs worked with EMC to understand their requirements and design a dedicated app for the iPad. BackUp Sketchpad is the result of our team thinking through the features that would make the most sense to someone holding an iPad on a busy conference floor.</p>

<h2>Better Than a Free Pen</h2>
<p>BackUp Sketchpad lets the EMC sales team arrange the company's data recovery products on a virtual canvas and annotate them using virtual pens and highlighters, giving potential customers a visualization of how EMC can improve their infrastructure. The sales team has many ways to share the plan from the app, including an output to a projector screen or Apple TV complete with a virtual pointer for presentations.</p>
