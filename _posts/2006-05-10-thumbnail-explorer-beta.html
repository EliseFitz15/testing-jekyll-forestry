<p>We're happy to announce the beta release of a new program called Thumbnail Explorer. The software is similar to our original Magic File program but this application is focused at viewing and searching for visual files. The software is a visual search engine for your PC.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quickly search for thumbnails, graphic files and CAD files quickly</li>
<li>Index thousands of folders and search them instantly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users can download a free trial version of <a href="/software/thumbnailexplorer/">Thumbnail Explorer.</a></p>
