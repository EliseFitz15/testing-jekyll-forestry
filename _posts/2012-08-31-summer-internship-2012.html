<p><strong>Chris, Developer Intern -</strong></p>
<p>"I came to Raizlabs with almost no experience with Objective-C," our intern Chris, a senior at Boston University, recalled, "from day one I was getting my hands dirty and learning in no time." Our developers quickly got Chris up to speed and had him working on our iPad application, Sketchpad HD, in no time.  "They took the time to make sure I understood what I was doing and there were always people around to help. It was also a very fun work environment, the community here is driven on pride in creating quality code," he elaborated.  When not working on Sketchpad, Chris assisted in debugging and QA testing other projects. "My internship at Raizlabs has helped prepare me for a job in the mobile industry as well as given me great memories and fun times. It gave me insight to a real work environment and helped me hone my skills as a developer."</p>
<p><strong>Connor, Software Developer Internship - </strong></p>
<p>Connor, another developer intern, came to Raizlabs from Bowdoin College in Brunswick, ME. "My summer internship at Raizlabs was a critical step in my foray into the technological world of business," he said. "Raizlabs fostered an environment that felt like home; a place of friendly and open people with creative minds and a drive to accomplish pushing the bounds of their potential each and every day." Connor was given the opportunity to develop applications under guidance from our entire development team. He tackled client projects and was essential in problem solving any issues that presented themselves throughout product development. "By the end not only had my understanding and comfort level of iOS excelled light-years ahead of where it was, I also gained valuable product management and Q/A experience." Connor will be joining our team full-time as a developer upon graduation from Bowdoin.</p>
<p><strong>Mike, AppBlade - Summer Internship</strong></p>
<p>Mike was our sole intern over the summer for AppBlade, a suite of tools for securing, distributing, and managing mobile applications. "From the start I was treated as a regular staff member and given challenging projects and assignments that helped me to learn the Ruby on Rails web framework and Android application programming," he remarked. "I was given help when I needed it most, and a constructive push at other times to figure things out for myself and learn on my own." During his time, Mike made a number of improvements to the AppBlade site by adding new features, building a notification system to further user engagement and improving ease of use. Additionally, Mike was the sole developer in creating an AppBlade Android MDM solution on both server and device side. "I feel much more comfortable and confident in my ability as a developer and I have gotten a feel for what it is like to work as a part of a team. The staff at Raizlabs are inviting, helpful, and know how to have fun in and outside of work," Mike remarked. In the future, Mike hope's to either be part of an tech startup company or start one himself. He added, "My experience at Raizlabs has shown me what it means to be a part of a small company, the influence I can have on a startup like AppBlade, and insight on how to be a part of a team with good examples of how to run one."</p>
