<p><img class="alignright" src="http://www.raizlabs.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/JetSetterScreenShot.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="336" />We recently released an updated version of our travel game JetSetter. The game allows people to compete against each other for travel miles.  Flyers can quickly log-in and see who's racked up the most travel miles in one week, one month or one whole year.</p>
<p>The new version adds the ability to complete against groups of flyers. So you can compete against a group of friends,  co-workers or travelers.</p>
<p>Many groups have already formed allowing pilots, passengers, flight crew and business travelers all compete for sky supremacy.</p>
