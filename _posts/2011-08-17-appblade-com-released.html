  We're excited to announce the release of a new service for companies doing application development and deployment. The new service, called <a href="http://www.appblade.com">AppBlade</a>, was launched today allowing companies to manage, test and deploy applications for iPhone, Android and other mobile devices.

  Traditionally, companies trying to deploy applications, especially iPhone, had to use a number of complex steps to get an application from a developer to a tester or enterprise customer. The process was confusing and involved too many steps. We set out to simplify the process and centralize the management.

<p>We're excited to announce the release of a new service for companies doing application development and deployment. The new service, called <a href="http://www.appblade.com">AppBlade</a>, was launched today allowing companies to manage, test and deploy applications for iPhone, Android and other mobile devices.</p>
<p>Traditionally, companies trying to deploy applications, especially iPhone, had to use a number of complex steps to get an application from a developer to a tester or enterprise customer. The process was confusing and involved too many steps. We set out to simplify the process and centralize the management.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-2309"></a></p>
<p>At its core, the initial launch of AppBlade does three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>AppBlade enables developers to deploy applications.<br />
Developers can deploy ad-hoc applications to limited sets of users or they can deploy in an enterprise configuration to hundreds or thousands of employees.</li>
<li>AppBlade enforces application usage.<br />
This allows companies to control who is using an application, it allows companies to auto-upgrade an application to ensure consistency and it allows you to kill switch one or many installs of the application without modifying the device.</li>
<li>AppBlade allows you visibility into how your application is used.<br />
You can see active and non-active users. You can see crash reports and statistics on your deployment and usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The service is available in three pricing tiers. For development companies managing apps, there is a monthly $49/month plan. For enterprises managing distribution, the pricing is $49/user/year.</p>
<p>The service has been developed and in production use for the last four months.  We are excited to bring it as a turn-key solution to other development companies and enterprise customers.</p>
