<p>In this week's episode of AppCorner we chat about Apple's win in their court battle against Samsung, the future of RFID and NFC payments via mobile devices and delve deeper into Twitter's API restrictions for developers. Of course, we also recommend our picks (or deletions) for app of the week!</p>
<p>AppCorner is hosted by the team at Raizlabs. This week's podcast crew included Greg Raiz (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/graiz" target="_blank">graiz</a>), Jason Petralia (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/jasonpetralia" target="_blank">jasonpetralia</a>), Dave Counts (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/davecounts" target="_blank">davecounts</a>) and Michelle Buchman (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/tres_michelle" target="_blank">tres_michelle</a>).</p>

<p>Apps and other cool things discussed in this weeks podcast include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/alien-blue-reddit-client/id370144106?mt=8" target="_blank">Alien Blue</a> - Alien Blue organizes Reddit into a fantastically packaged app that is easy to use and customizable. Alien Blue allows you to sign in with your Reddit username, vote on submissions, leave comments, and perform all other major functions available to a Reddit user. A nice perk of Alien Blue is that it comes equipped with a list of the most popular subreddits ready to be personalized with a few taps of the screen. Of course Alien Blue also allows you to check your inbox and flips easily to be viewed sideways as well as upright. The Pro Upgrade also offers the option to create posts, image galleries, tilt scroll, as well as a number of other options.<strong></strong></li>
<li><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hipmunk-hotel-flight-search/id419950680?mt=8" target="_blank">Hipmunk</a> - Hipmunk takes the agony out of flight &amp; hotel search. With Hipmunk you'll see all the relevant flights on a timeline, helping you visualize the right choice. Unlike every other app out there, Hipmunk doesn't just show you the cheapest flight first — the app instead sorts by "agony," which incorporates important factors like how long you'll be traveling and how many stops you'll make. Hotel results are shown on a map so that you can see exactly where you'll be staying. You can also turn on heatmaps that will show you the best areas to stay based on unique interests like food, landmarks, nightlife and more. Hipmunk also makes booking easy. When you've found the right flight or hotel, you can either book it from your mobile device, email it to someone else, or finish booking on your desktop computer.</li>
