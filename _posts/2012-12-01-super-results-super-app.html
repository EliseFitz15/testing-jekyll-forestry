<p><img class="size-full wp-image-4360 alignright" style="margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px" title="SuperPac App Animation" src="http://www.raizlabs.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/SuperPac.gif" alt="" width="206" height="396" />During the presidential race we were able to work on an exciting project to help bring transparency to the onslaught of presidential ads. The <a href="http://www.superpacapp.org/" target="_blank">SuperPacApp</a> allowed users to audio sample political ads and learn the truth. Here's a round up of just some of the press the app received:</p>

<p>In total, the app logged 119,815 user sessions with 50,014 claims explored. Additionally, 38,351 ad ratings were tallied. 122 countries were represented in usage of the app. The application also <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/14/interactive-daily-beast-super-pac-app-election-ad-tracker.html" target="_blank">partnered with Newsweek and The Daily Beast</a> to bring the app's ad tracking data to visitor's desktops.</p>
<p>To continue the transparency the data and source code for the project has been made available for download on <a href="http://superpacapp.org">SuperPacApp.org</a></p>
