<p>Jon learned design early on in his first photography classes at East Carolina University (Go Pirates!). Moving from photo 101 through studio photography and alternative print processing he graduated up to digital imaging with Photoshop 3 (not meant to be dating him here... but he's used the tool a bit).</p>
<p>Working on a number of mobile Appstore wins  in the past including HotelPal, Flightrack, Flightboard, Expedia, The Merriam-Webster's Dictionary App, and many others; he's been around the block when it comes to mobile UI/UX design.</p>
<p>Jon finds design inspiration everywhere, and sees all the pixels we push, even the retina ones.  A believer in form follows function, great design isn't just how something looks—it's also how it works and how it feels. Jons focus is to make sure the designs for mobile we create are original, clean and inspirational.</p>
<p>Jon is a bit of an engineer, a tinkerer and a sponge for information and you can find him commuting to work or spending time with his wife and three (you read that right) children.</p>
