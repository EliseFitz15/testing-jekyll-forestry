<h1>How do you highlight a store the size of a city block?</h1>
<h2 class="highlight" style="font-size: 24px">You Geofence it and give it indoor mapping.</h2>
<p>Macy’s, Inc. approached Raizlabs to create an extraordinary mobile app to highlight the experience of their flagship store, Macy’s Herald Square in New York City.</p>
<p>The vision was to create a product that would deliver Macy’s consumers an immersive retail and in-store experience. Raizlabs designed and developed a dynamic app across iPhone, iPad, and Android to accomplish this goal.</p>

<h1>Custom Map and Content Management</h1>
<h2 class="highlight" style="font-size: 24px">Designed for Interaction.</h2>
<p>The Raizlabs engineering team created a custom content management system, allowing Macy’s to increase customer engagement. With the custom content management system, Macy’s could share and display features such as store events, restaurant menus, indoor maps, and store offers.</p>
<p>As the first mobile development company to partner with Meridian, an indoor mapping technology, we were also able to offer in-store, turn-by-turn navigation maps to further uncomplicate the customer experience.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center">A new york holiday tradition ready for a new generation</h1>
<p style="text-align: center">For the holidays, we also brought their timeless Santaland tradition into the new century with a reservation system for holiday visitors. We built the Express Pass system within the Macy’s mobile app and also for in-store kiosks on dedicated iPads, to allow the ability for customers to skip the line by booking their Macy’s Herald Square Santaland visit ahead of time.</p>

<h1>Multiplatform in Sync</h1>
<p>Raizlabs worked with Macy's to make their experience available to as wide an audience as possible, including both iOS and Android. With the same feature set and indoor mapping across platforms, no one was left out of the magic that is Macy's Herald Square.<br />
