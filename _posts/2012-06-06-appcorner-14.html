<p>In this week's episode of AppCorner we talk with two of our developers for an all E3 edition of AppCorner. E3, the Electronic Entertainment Expo, serves as the annual trade fair for the computer and video games industry. Companies such as Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony present their newest hardware and games to consumers and media. This year Microsoft debuted SmartGlass, Nintendo showcased the Wii U and Sony showed off the Move controller and Vita. Additionally, we have our recommendations for apps of the week as usual.</p>
<p>AppCorner is hosted by the team at Raizlabs. This week's podcast crew included Bruno Germansderfer (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/brunog" target="_blank">@brunog</a>), Alex Rouse, Nick Donaldson and Michelle Buchman (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/tres_michelle" target="_blank">@tres_michelle</a>).</p>
