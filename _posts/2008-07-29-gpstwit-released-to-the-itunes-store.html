GPS Twit is a new application that makes it easy for your friends and contacts to track your location around the world. The application is freely available from the iTunes application store for IPhone devices as well as for Windows mobile phones. Users can visit <a href="http://www.gpstwit.com">www.gpstwit.com</a> to download the application. The software integrates with the popular TwitterÂ website allowing users to post their status information along with their GPS position.</p>
<p>Over the last three months Raizlabs has been developing several IPhone applications. "We feel that the mobile platform, and especially the IPhone will be a popular for application design and development and we wanted to get ahead of the curve." said Gregory Raiz, founder of Raizlabs.  While the GPS Twit application is simple in it's function it provides a unique and transparent way to pass and post location data.</p>
<p>GPS Twit enables people to pass location data back and forth without joining a new social network. The initial rollout supports Twitter however additional networks are in the works.</p>
