Raizlabs recently designed and developed an iPhone mobile app for Sermo. The application allows physicians to take a photo can get instant consultations from other physicians.  <a id="more"></a><a id="more-2162"></a></p>
<p>Sermo is the largest online physician network in the US.  Sermo's network of practicing US physicians to collaborate on difficult cases and exchange observations about drugs, devices and clinical issues. The newly developed app is an iPhone version of the Sermo site.</p>
<p>One of the key features of the app, iConsult, allows physicians to take a picture of an interesting case and upload it to the network for a consultation. Say your family doctor is stumped by your son's rash.  He pulls out his iPhone, snaps a photo, pushes a couple of buttons to pose a precomposed question and then selects the Dermatology category. Within seconds, a dermatologist (or any doctor) on Sermo can see the photo and offer assistance.   The basic app permits a doctor with a smartphone to put the camera and the network to work for better diagnostics and education.</p>
<p>Greg Raiz, founder of Raizlabs is enthusiastic about the potential:</p>
<blockquote><p>What's exciting about Sermo is that it really enables real-time communication between doctors. This type of app enables a twitter-like discussion in a secure doctor to doctor setting.  We're excited about the initial version and hope that it proves to be a valuable tool for doctors and physicians.</p></blockquote>
