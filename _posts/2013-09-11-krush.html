<h1>ON-TREND MEANS ON-THE-GO</h1>
<p>Krush is a network where users share images of lifestyle-driven products, people and brands. The company sought out Raizlabs to bring their online experience into the hands of its users, allowing for on-the-go discovery of the latest trends.<br />

<h1>Getting Results</h1>
<p>Raizlabs built a high-quality app that was hot right out of the gate, getting featured as a New and Noteworthy app in the App Store's Lifestyle category and endorsed by pro skateboarder Rob Dyrdek on his own website and Twitter. Krush saw a nice bump in engagement in the process.</p>
<h1>How it Happened</h1>
<p>We worked to create a visually stunning app that matches the feel of a site dedicated to the curation of product images. We focused on features that mattered most to continuing the social experience of Krush.com into the mobile space.<br />
