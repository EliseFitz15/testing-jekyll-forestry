<p>The Super Bowl is fast approaching, but the conversations are about more than just the game. As the biggest event of the year for commercials, it's important to pay attention to the messages delivered beyond the brand name or slogan.</p>
<p>That's where #NotBuyingIt and <a href="http://therepresentationproject.org/">The Representation Project</a> come in.</p>
<p>The hashtag took off during the 2012 Super Bowl, when it was used to start a live conversation around sexism in the most watched commercials of the year (and was a nationally trending topic during the game). From there, its exploded to become its own movement - from pushing brands like Amazon and GoDaddy to change practices, like the removal of local billboards objectifying women.</p>

<p>From Australia to Uganda, and Boston to San Francisco, people everywhere are taking a stand.</p>
<p>“When I first heard that The Representation Project was building an app for #NotBuyingIt, I immediately reached out to them about it,” said Raizlabs product manager Katie Tomezsko. “I knew that Raizlabs could build something amazing.”</p>
<p>Over the course of several months, the two groups formed a very rewarding collaboration, partaking in a mission of gender equality and building an <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notbuyingit/id799844884?mt=8">iPhone app</a>.</p>
<p>The Director of Communications at The Representation Project, Imran Siddiquee, reflected, "we're so thrilled to have released the #NotBuyingIt app - giving consumers the power to talk back to sexism in the media. And we're especially proud of creating this tool with Raizlabs and their team of developers. From the beginning, Katie and her team really understood the mission and vision behind the #NotBuyingIt campaign, which made a huge difference in building an effective app for social change."</p>
<p>“The effort to spark and continue conversations around gendered portrayals in the media and advertising is something I’m very passionate about,” Tomeszko said. “And it was an amazing team effort. Nearly everyone who works at Raizlabs pitched in, and I’m so proud and excited that it’s live in the App Store."</p>
