<h1 class="center-text">Making a Great Idea Mobile</h1>
<p class="center-text">Inbound marketing leader HubSpot wanted to take its successful Marketing Grader tool—a quick website evaluator showing potential customers their strengths and shortcomings—and extend it to mobile. The site works well to generate leads, but HubSpot approached Raizlabs for something that would work on the DreamForce conference floor.</p>

<h1>Getting Results</h1>
<p>In addition to building an iPad app, Raizlabs provided HubSpot with something invaluable: the ability to give demos across the conference floor, instead of just being tied to a booth. As a result, the team was able to develop more quality leads than ever before.</p>
<h1>How it Happened</h1>
<p>Raizlabs worked with HubSpot to rethink the Marketing Grader tool and optimize it for the iPad. We were able to take the website experience and turn it into a beautifully designed mobile app.<br />

<h1 class="center-text">Numbers Don't Lie</h1>
<p class="center-text">Marketing Grader is effective because it instantly gives hard data that shows companies how their web presence ranks among their peers. The iPad tool brings all of that to life in a visually approachable way. That freed up the conference team to explain the HubSpot product and vision.</p>
