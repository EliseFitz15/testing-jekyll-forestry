Last week, he traveled to Haiti on a humanitarian trip. Bob found himself in the remote village of Belle Vie on the island of La Gonave, where technology rarely is seen by the island’s almost 80,000 residents. The trip was organized by a <a href="http://godsministryinlagonave.org/" target="_blank">charity</a> that operates a school for about 150 kids in the small village. They help run educational programs and provide medical services to those residing in Belle Vie. Bob brought his iPhone and iPad with him on the trip and gave the kids an opportunity to use a few apps, including Sketch Pad, developed by Raizlabs.

<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-2819"></a>SketchPad HD is a simple drawing and note taking application that allows users to draw in a variety of colors, collect, browse through and share notes created on the iPad via e-mail. The children quickly took to the application. “The kids loved playing with Sketch Pad...and it was amazing how quickly they learned to use it.  They really had never seen anything quite like it,” he added.</p>
