<p><strong>An Apple Device for Every Need</strong></p>
<p>What instances would consumers use an iPad Mini over a regular iPad? Most people in general have three devices they use regularly. Apple wants to be your sole source for all of these device needs. There's your desktop or laptop - covered by the iMac or MacBook, your phone - covered by the iPhone, and then a third portable device - be it the iPod, iPod Touch or iPad, meant for mobility. Apple wants to fill the gap for that "on the go" device.</p>
<p>While the original iPad was marketed as a living room, couch device, it ended up finding a niche in portability. The iPad mini will likely cement that difference leaving its larger brother on the couch. While the Macbook is great for typing or creating documents in Keynote, it's not ideal for working while commuting, watching TV or reading in bed. The full-size iPad might be too big for using Maps' turn-by-turn navigation, but the smaller screen size on a Mini is perfect to use in car and easier to see routes than on an iPhone. The Mini is all about being that device for when you are out and about.</p>
<p><strong>Education. Education. Education.</strong></p>
<p>The biggest reason by far for the existence of the iPad Mini is for educational use. Apple has long wanted to integrate their products into the classroom with teachers and students. While the $329 is higher then expected this price is lower then the larger iPad allowing educators to buy more Mini's in bulk for classroom use, compared to the higher $499 starting price of the iPad with retina display. Students will be more comfortable using the smaller 7.9" screen which fits in one hand instead of the larger size of the 9.5" iPad. The new Mini is optimal for reading use as well, with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibooks/id364709193?mt=8">iBooks</a> and Newstand as two of the built-in apps on the device. During the event Apple also announced an iBooks 3.0 update at the same time, to emphasize the Mini's use as a reading/educational tool. The pre-holiday season timing of the event also works well for schools, who need to place their orders for upcoming school year materials before June. Staying up to date with the latest editions of textbooks is easier on a tablet rather than ordering all new physical copies, often an expensive order for schools. The iPad Mini offers educators mobility and cutting-edge technology at an affordable price.</p>

<p><strong>Smaller Screen, Better Apps?</strong></p>
<p>So what apps could actually benefit from a smaller 7.9" screen size? Certainly magazines situated in the Newstand app will look great. Instead of attempting to read issues in small text on an iPhone, users will have a better size device that places less strain on the eyes. Travel apps such as National Geographic's <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/national-parks-by-national/id518426085?mt=8" target="_blank">National Parks</a> app, a 2012 Apple Design Award winner for iPhone, will look fantastic on an iPad Mini with the 163 pixels per inch screen resolution. Educational science applications such as <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/star-walk-5-stars-astronomy/id295430577?mt=8" target="_blank">Star Walk</a> benefit from the size of the Mini by offering a bigger screen to explore the constellations on, providing more space and depth than small screen viewing on an iPhone. In addition, the smaller form factor could be beneficial to those in the medical profession. The thinner size is perfect as a device for doctors to carry around rather than a bulkier laptop or iPad.</p>
<p>Priced starting at $329, Apple makes a statement in the confidence they have in the iPad Mini dominating over lower priced tablets like the Kindle Fire ($199) or Nexus 7 ($199.) The iPad Mini is just 7.2mm compared with Kindle Fire at 10mm and the Nexus at 10.45mm. It's also lighter at just 308 grams vs the Fire at 395 grams and the Nexus at 340 grams.</p>
<p>CEO Tim Cook spoke at Apple's Q4 Earning's report when questioned about the higher than anticipated pricing, saying the iPad Mini is a "premium device" and users expect that certain level of quality in devices from Apple. Â He added, "It is not a compromised product like the seven inch tablets. It's in a whole different league." So, why do we need the Mini in the first place? It serves as a high-end tablet device that emphasizes mobility. By making the screen the same resolution as the iPad 2, the iPad Mini makes for a good tablet option at a lesser price. If consumers and businesses embrace this new tablet as the third device Apple wants them to own, the iPad Mini will have longevity in a market that is gaining traction fast.</p>
