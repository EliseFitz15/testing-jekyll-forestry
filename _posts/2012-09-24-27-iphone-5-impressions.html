<p>In this week's episode of AppCorner we chat about our first impressions of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank">iPhone 5</a> - the taller screen, lighter weight, panorama camera mode, etc. We also chat to two of our developers, Ben and Alex, about their experience waiting in line overnight for the phone and coding an app while in line. Of course, we also recommend our picks (or deletions) for app of the week!</p>
<p>AppCorner is hosted by the team at Raizlabs. This week's podcast crew included Greg Raiz (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/graiz" target="_blank">graiz</a>), Ben Johnson (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/scoober" target="_blank">scoober</a>), Dave Counts (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/davecounts" target="_blank">davecounts</a>), Jason Petralia (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/jasonpetralia" target="_blank">jasonpetralia</a>), Alex Rouse (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/arrouse88" target="_blank">arrouse88</a>) and Katie Tomezsko (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/ctomezsko" target="_blank">CTomezsko</a>).</p>
