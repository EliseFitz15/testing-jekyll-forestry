  In this week's episode of AppCorner we chat about the world of e-commerce and mobile shopping. <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/11/25/apple-ipad-black-friday/" target="_blank">Apple's iPad led the way on Black Friday</a> this year, taking 10% of all online shopping - more than any other tablet or smartphone.  Mobile shopping in general rose 20.7% on Black Friday from 2011. We also discuss General Motor's announcement they will be bringing <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/12/11/27/gm-will-be-first-automaker-to-use-apples-eyes-free-siri-integration" target="_blank">Siri integration to their Chevy Sonic and Spark</a> cars next year. Of course, we also recommend our picks (or deletions) for app of the week!
