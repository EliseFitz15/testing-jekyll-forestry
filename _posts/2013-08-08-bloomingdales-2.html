<h1 class="highlight">Bloomingdale's</h1>
<h2>The ultimate store app</h2>
<p>Bloomingdale’s, a division of Macy’s Inc., approached Raizlabs to create a mobile application for their flagship New York City store at 59th St. and Lexington Ave. As America’s only nationwide, full-line, upscale department store, Bloomingdale’s sought an extraordinary tool to highlight the full experience of shopping at its most well-known location.<br />

<h2>Getting Results</h2>
<p>Bloomingdale's customers who use the app on their phones in-store have an unparalleled, immersive retail experience.</p>
<h2>How it Happened</h2>
<p>Raizlabs built a custom content management system so that Bloomingdale's could share and display features including restaurant menus, indoor maps and fashion picks. In putting together a mobile strategy, we identified features that were both practical (shopping lists, directories) and fantastical (augmented reality viewer for holiday window displays).<br />

<h2>Going Up?</h2>
<p>Mirroring the store's iconic elevators, the app shows floor maps that are searchable down to department and brand name. Customers can also find a list of store restaurants, menus and hours, as well as store-wide offers and events.</p>
<h2>Technology and Service</h2>
<p>Raizlabs continues to work with Bloomingdale’s to update the app with engaging features, content and media through the custom content management system. To date, we have provided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideation and mobile strategy.</li>
<li>iPhone and Android development and design.</li>
<li>Custom content management system.</li>
<li>Social media integration.</li>
<li>Push notifications.</li>
<li>Add and edit shopping list feature.</li>
<li>Indoor mapping.</li>
</ul>
