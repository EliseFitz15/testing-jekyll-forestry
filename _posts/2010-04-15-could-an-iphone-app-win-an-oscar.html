<p><strong><em>2010 Boston International Film Festival Is the First Major Festival to Show An iPhone Application </em></strong></p>
<div>BOSTON, Massachusetts (April 15, 2010)  - WALKING CINEMA: MURDER ON BEACON HILL is not a film, it’s an iPhone app, but its innovative, lush storytelling earned it a place in the 2010 Boston International Film Festival on April 18th. Based on the PBS film MURDER AT HARVARD, this location-based app is a real-life murder mystery told in short videos that layer over a map of present-day Beacon Hill.  "We were just blown away at how watchable the story is in a theatrical setting.  It’s quick-paced, full of juicy details, and, to our knowledge, it’s the first location-based application to screen at a film festival,” said Festival Director Patrick Jerome.</div>

<p>WALKING CINEMA: MURDER ON BEACON HILL is a multimedia story of John Webster, a Harvard Professor accused of murdering and dismembering one of Boston’s richest men in 1849. GPS information enables users to conduct their own guided, interactive tour of significant crime scenes throughout Boston.  The director of WALKING CINEMA, Michael Epstein, calls it “a page-turner mystery powered by your feet.”</p>
</div>
<div>The application is currently the most and highest rated “walking tour” application in the iTunes App Store and can be previewed at <a href="http://www.parkmanmurder.com">www.parkmanmurder.com</a>. “We’ve seen downloads of the application coming from over 30 countries and we believe that many are viewing it as an armchair mystery while locals and tourists here are walking with the story as hands-on history,” Epstein says.</div>
<p>Funded in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities and developed in partnership with Raizlabs in Brookline, MA, Epstein says that one of the goals of the project was to develop a multi-platform film that led to thoughtful engagement with history and geography.</p>
<p>WALKING CINEMA: MURDER ON BEACON HILL will be shown at 8:15 p.m. on Sunday April 18, 2010 at the Boston Common AMC Theater. Tickets are available through the Boston International Film Festival site <a href="http://www.bifilmfestival.com/biffschedule.html">http://www.bifilmfestival.com/biffschedule.html</a>. The Boston International Film Festival runs from April 16 to April 25, 2010. The festival strives to bring together in Boston local, national and international filmmakers by promoting the world’s most artistic and creative independent and experimental films.</p>
