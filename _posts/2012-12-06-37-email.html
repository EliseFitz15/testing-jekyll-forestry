  In this week's episode of AppCorner we chat about the world of email. Google just released their <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-gmail-app-for-iphone-and-ipad.html" target="_blank">completely re-designed Gmail application</a> for iOS - we discuss the positives and negatives and our overall thoughts. Additionally, we chat about the gamification of email, our favorite desktop + mobile email clients, and muse on a world without email. Of course, we also recommend our picks (or deletions) for app of the week!

  AppCorner is hosted by the team at Raizlabs. This week's regular podcast crew included Greg Raiz (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/graiz" target="_blank">graiz</a>), Dave Counts (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/davecounts" target="_blank">davecounts</a>), Ben Johnson (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/scoober" target="_blank">scoober</a>) and Michelle Buchman (@<a href="http://twitter.com/tres_michelle" target="_blank">tres_michelle</a>).

Apps and other cool things discussed in this weeks podcast include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://emailga.me/" target="_blank">The Email Game</a> - The Email Game isn’t for people who love e-mail. It’s for folks who <em>despise</em> e-mail — or at least feel like they’re drowning in a sea of messages that never stops. The site provides an alternative interface for Gmail that shows you one message at a time and encourages you to deal with it immediately and tracks how quickly and thoroughly you empty your inbox. Features like the ability to respond with canned text make it a genuinely useful productivity tool.</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical/id575647534?mt=8" target="_blank">Fantastical</a> - Fantastical is the fastest and friendliest calendar app. Just type in "Lunch with John in Cupertino on Friday" and Fantastical will schedule it! If your device supports dictation you can also speak the details for your event and Fantastical will handle the rest. Best of all, the beautiful interface makes using your calendar fun and easy.</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mbta-mticket/id560487958?ls=1&amp;mt=8" target="_blank">MBTA mTicket</a> - With the new MBTA mTicket App for Commuter Rail and Ferry, you can securely purchase MBTA Commuter Rail and Ferry Single Ride, Round-Trip, 10 Ride, and Monthly tickets in seconds. Purchasing a ticket is easy: select your trip &amp; ticket type, enter your payment card information and your smartphone is your ticket!</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/leonard-maltin-movie-guide/id331933187?mt=8" target="_blank">Leonard Maltin Movie Guide</a> - The Leonard Maltin Movie Guide places essential facts for over 25,000 films at your fingertips including consistent ratings and capsule reviews summarizing plot quality and often great tidbits of information.</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hype-machine/id414315986?mt=8" target="_blank">Hype Machine</a> - Discover the most talked-about music from blogs around the world. Every day, thousands of people around the world write about music they love — and it all ends up on Hype Machine. We watch for new posts on over 800 of the most interesting blogs and make it easy to follow this chaotic world. You can listen to the newest tracks posted just minutes ago, the most popular tracks of the day, and check out what your friends have discovered on the service. Each week, we also hand-pick an album that you can stream in its entirety before you can buy it. All this, without ads or monthly fees.</li>
