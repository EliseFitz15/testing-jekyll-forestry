<p>In this week's episode of AppCorner we chat about <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/09/28/tim_cook_apologizes_for_apple_maps_suggests_google_maps_as_alternative.html" target="_blank">Apple's Maps fiasco</a> and the inefficiency of the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/09/app-store-gets-an-organizational-boost-in-ios-6/" target="_blank">search feature in the new App Store</a> update for iOS 6. Of course, we also recommend our picks (or deletions) for app of the week!</p>
