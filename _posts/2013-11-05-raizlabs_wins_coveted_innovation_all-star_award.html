<p>Raizlabs was recognized as a 2013 Innovation All-Star by the <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/profiles/company/us/ma/boston/boston_business_journal/977439">Boston Business Journal</a> and <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/profiles/company/us/ma/boston/mass_high_tech/961047">Mass High Tech</a> last month. The award was given to the top 15 companies in the Boston area that exemplify innovation.</p>
<p>“Innovation has been at the heart of our company and the products we’ve been developing for years," Founder and CEO Greg Raiz said of the achievement. “Our engineers and designers look to really understand the platforms we work with and push the technology in new directions. It’s this type of exploration that helps us keep up with the rapid pace of change and allows us to stay fresh on the newest technology such as RFID, Google Glass or Low Energy Bluetooth.”</p>
<p>Raiz added that the Raizlabs team has had a great year so far, celebrating the company's ten year anniversary and continuing to set themselves apart with internal efforts and social events. The team is looking forward to Hack Day, a bi-monthly day dedicated to stimulating creative juices by trying new things and working on external projects.</p>
