  In this week's episode of AppCorner we chat all about music apps, inspired by the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/us-news-blog/2013/jan/15/myspace-justin-timberlake-facebook-announcement" target="_blank">launch of the "new" Myspace</a> which is heavily focused around music now. As always, we also pick our favorite apps and recommend them to listeners.

  AppCorner is hosted by the team at Raizlabs. This week's regular podcast crew included Greg Raiz (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/graiz" target="_blank">graiz</a>), Dave Counts (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/davecounts" target="_blank">davecounts</a>), Jonathan Green (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/gildedsplinter" target="_blank">gildedsplinter</a>), Michelle Buchman (@<a href="http://twitter.com/tres_michelle" target="_blank">tres_michelle</a>) and Nick Donaldson.
