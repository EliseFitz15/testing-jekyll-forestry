<p>In this week's episode of AppCorner we come to you from the West Coast for a WWDC edition of AppCorner. Â The World Wide Developer Conference is a yearly event primarily used by Apple to showcase their new software and technologies for developers, as well as offering tech sessions throughout the week and hands-on labs. We discussed this year's opening keynote which revealed updates to Apple's various hardware, software, apps and operating systems.
