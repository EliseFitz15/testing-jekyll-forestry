<h1>Caring about <span class="highlight">results</span></h1>
<p>Care.com connects families seeking various types of caregivers to a network of individuals looking for meaningful work. The company approached Raizlabs for help in revamping its iPhone app.</p>
<p>The new Care.com app by Raizlabs earned a 4.5 star ratingâ€”a remarkable improvement over the 1.5 rating for the previous version. The new app also brought more transactions between parties onto the Care.com platform, increasing their revenue.<br />

<h1>How it Happened</h1>
<p>Raizlabs identified the existing app's mix of mobile web and native iOS code as a potential problem, so we started over from scratch and built an entirely native iPhone application, making sure to carry forward the existing features with which current users were familiar.</p>
<h1>Making Meaningful Connections</h1>
<p>By focusing on the specific mobile experience of a family seeking a caregiver, Raizlabs was able to find new ways to make the app easy to use and continually engage users over time. As a result, more families and caregivers connect on Care.com and remain there rather than dropping off the platform.<br />
