<p>Glassy Media, based in Cambridge, had the idea of empowering voters with digital tools to separate facts from fabrications. The company approached Raizlabs to help them bring their idea for a mobile application to life. The Super PAC App, launched this Wednesday in the App Store, enables users to quickly access information about an ad by holding their mobile device up to the television. Using audio fingerprinting technology the app recognizes the ad, identifies the SuperPAC group that financed it, and lets users explore the claims mentioned in the ad. Users can share information they find through email, SMS, Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>Super PAC App was born out of a class project at MIT's Media Lab from Harvard Kennedy School grad Jennifer Hollett and MIT Sloan grad Dan Siegel. The pair were inspired by the rise in how people use a "second screen" such as tablets, laptops or smartphones, while they watch television. Siegel and Hollett started work in February and approached Raizlabs to aid them in developing the app for the upcoming election season. The team at Raizlabs “had a fantastic time working with Jenn and Dan on their vision” said Ben Johnson (Product Engineer here at Raizlabs), “it’s an inventive use of technology and a fairly complex problem.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, the application has been covered by CNN, ABC News, The Washington Post, Mashable, The Verge, Lifehacker, Media Bistro and Mediatite. On launch day, the app hit #1 under top free apps in the news category and went on to crack the top 100 free apps overall. The app is now available for free download in the App Store.</p>
