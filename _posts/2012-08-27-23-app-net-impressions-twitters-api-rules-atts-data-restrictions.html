<p>In this week's episode of AppCorner we chat about <a href="http://www.app.net/" target="_blank">App.net</a> (one of the first PAID social networks), <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/att-facetime-fcc/" target="_blank">AT&amp;T's FaceTime restrictions</a> over cellular and the impact of <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/08/16/twitter-api-big-changes/" target="_blank">Twitter's new API restrictions</a> for developers and users. Of course, we also recommend our picks (or deletions) for app of the week!</p>
<p>AppCorner is hosted by the team at Raizlabs. This week's podcast crew included Greg Raiz (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/graiz" target="_blank">graiz</a>), Craig Spitzkoff (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/arrouse88" target="_blank">oofoot</a>), Dave Counts (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/davecounts" target="_blank">davecounts</a>), Ben Johnson (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/scoober" target="_blank">scoober</a>) and Michelle Buchman (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/tres_michelle" target="_blank">tres_michelle</a>).</p>

<p>Apps and other cool things discussed in this weeks podcast include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/super-pac-app/id552140731?mt=8" target="_blank">Super PAC App</a> - A free, fun, and simple way to find out more about the presidential election ads coming out of your TV. Identify commercials from all political groups, including Super PACs and the official campaigns. <strong></strong></li>
<li><a href="http://www.backdispatch.com" target="_blank">Dispatch</a> - Use all of your available Internet connections at once to maximize speed &amp; reliability with Dispatch. With Connectify Dispatch, you can even use two different Wi-Fi networks at the same time. Just connect a secondary USB Wi-Fi card (complimentary for $100+ backers), in addition to your laptop’s on-board Wi-Fi card, and Dispatch does the rest.</li>
<li><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/habit-list-track-your-goals/id525102168?mt=8" target="_blank">Habit List</a> - Intuitive and flexible, Habit List helps you create good habits and break unhealthy ones. Stay on track, keep your to-do list uncluttered, and see big changes through little steps. Focus on what’s due - No need to wade through all your habits to figure out what to do, Habit List only shows what’s due today. And you can set the default order for your habits, so items that you’ll complete first are at the top of your list. Stay on track with reminders - Habits are powerful because they’re automatic, but while you’re building routines, reminders are indispensable. Track your progress - See your history at a glance and gain insight into what’s working—or isn’t. Habit List also tracks your personal best (longest streak) and all-time completion rate.</li>

<li><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/image-to-text-ocr/id431757093?mt=8" target="_blank">Image to Text</a> - Allows you to extract editable ASCII text from images, and share the results by EMAIL or EVERNOTE. The app is free, very easy to use, and requires NO REGISTRATION. Simply take a picture of a document that you would like to extract text from, and e-mail the image to yourself, co-workers, friends. You will all receive not only the image but a text file that contains the editable text that is extracted from the image.</li>
