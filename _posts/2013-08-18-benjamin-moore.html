<h1>Benjamin Moore Needed A NEW <span class="highlight">Shade </span>OF MOBILE<span><br />
</span></h1>
<p>When Benjamin Moore needed to refresh their approach to mobile, they called on Raizlabs to develop a series of color applications. We worked with the paint company to reengineer their Color Capture app from the ground up while also producing a new color tool for painting professionals.</p>
<h2>Finding that perfect match</h2>
<p>We launched the revamped Color Capture app on iPhone, iPad and Android to rave reviews, winning public acclaim and the industry MOBI award for innovation. The ensuing ProConnection app was likewise a hit with painting professionals, offering Benjamin Moore a two-pronged boost in mobile engagement across its entire customer base.<br />

<h1>How it Happened</h1>
<p>Raizlabs started with a clean slate for Color Capture, exploring both the design and visual approach of an application designed to take a picture of a color and match it to one of Benjamin Moore's color libraries. We also worked with the company's color scientists on the app's technology for color harmonies, and then we rebuilt Color Capture from scratch. This work informed the ProConnection project, but we wanted to take a very different approach when we set out to design the professional tool.</p>
<h1>From Consumer To Pro</h1>
<p>There's a big difference between DIY consumers and professionals who paint thousands of square feet a month. ProConnection gives professional painters a tool that they can use on the job, with access to the best tools and data available. The app allows them to track not only the colors they are using, but also the relative humidity of their clients’ locations and the square feet of paint needed. They can also keep track of the overall job, with its many rooms, locations and colors.<br />
