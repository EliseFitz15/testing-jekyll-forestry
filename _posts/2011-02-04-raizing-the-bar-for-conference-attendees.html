  edition of its annual conference, SolidWorks World, 3D software giant SolidWorks
  wanted to offer attendees an app that would help them schedule their days and find
  their way through the expansive Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center.  Having seen
  Raizlabs' app for another conference, SolidWorks turned to Raizlabs to develop an
  app that not only allows attendees to plan their day and find their way through
  the massive, multi-level convention center, but also helps them engage their fellow
  attendees through Twitter, Flickr, Facebook and YouTube.

<p><a title="gfxspeak" href="http://gfxspeak.com/2011/01/19/theres-an-app-for-solidworks-world-2011/" target="_blank">GraphicSpeak</a>, a website for news and commentary for computer design professionals, noted that "This app is simply brilliant in design and execution. All the logos are 3D and spin when selected. The information is well organized. SolidWorks raises the bar for what conference attendees should expect from their hosts."</p>
<p>Raizlabs graphic designer Dave Counts added, "There are a lot of cookie-cutter event apps out there.  I'm proud that our custom development included animated, 3D elements for this 3D software convention."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/archive2010/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/SWW11-iphone-app-photo-1.png"></a><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/solidworks-world-2011/id413634313?mt=8" target="_blank">The app is free to download for all iPhone</a> users and requires the most recent version of iOS.  Features of the app include:</p>
<ul>
<li>All sessions listed by schedule and by speaker</li>
<li>Biographies of all speakers</li>
<li>Floor plans for all conference locations, including interactive maps of the conference</li>
<li>A link to an attendees’ personal schedules</li>
<li>Exhibitor directory and other show floor details</li>
<li>Addresses and maps for all off-site events and primary hotel</li>
<li>Links directly to the Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube feeds of the show</li>
</ul>
<p>“Our events team really ran the project,” says Matthew West, manager of social media for SolidWorks marketing. “The idea was to give people an easy way to navigate the show and stay up to date on the news. It also gives people who aren’t regular Twitter/Facebook/Flickr users a way to see those updates in a single interface.”</p>
<p>Greg Raiz, founder of Raizlabs noted, "Attendees can have a much better event experience if they have the right information in their pocket. Quality mobile apps can simplify logistics, save on printing costs and increase satisfaction. We see this as just the beginning for conferences as attendees want us to continue to <em>Raiz</em> the bar."</p>
