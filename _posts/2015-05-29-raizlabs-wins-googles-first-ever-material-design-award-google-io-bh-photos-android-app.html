<h1>Google’s first-ever Material Design Award</h1>
<p>At the 2015 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O">Google I/O developer’s conference</a> on Thursday, Google announced Raizlabs client B&amp;H Photo a recipient of their <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2015/05/announcing-material-design-showcase-and.html">first-ever Material Design Award</a>. The award was presented to six design pioneers for their outstanding and noteworthy execution of Material Design. The showcase recognizes excellence in applying Google’s new Material Design to create engaging user experiences. <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/work/bh-photo-android-material-design/">Raizlabs’ client B&amp;H Photo</a> was highlighted by Google’s Design team for its immersive use of imagery. Other winners of the Material Design Award were New York Times, Tumblr, Pocket, Weather Timeline, and Pocket Casts.</p>
<p>Onstage at Google I/O, Google’s VP of Material Design, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat%C3%ADas_Duarte">Matias Duarte</a>, had this to say: “We wanted to recognize some specific executions of Material that we thought were particularly excellent or noteworthy. So we created a Material Design Award. And this year we decided to give it out to six different categories and we would like to acknowledge these Material Design pioneers.”</p>

<p>After Google’s announcement of Material Design in mid-2014, Raizlabs worked with B&amp;H Photo to completely revamp their Android app—anticipating that the redesign would give B&amp;H a competitive advantage on the Play Store. Raizlabs, a <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/">digital interactive agency focusing on mobile app development</a>, was B&amp;H’s partner in helping to implement their cutting-edge mobile app strategy. The partnership enabled the two companies to consistently spin out exciting new features to B&amp;H customers across mobile devices everywhere.</p>
<p>With the goal of releasing the most beautiful e-commerce experience on Android, Raizlabs was excited to get to work crafting a gorgeous new update for B&amp;H Photo. New Material Design-inspired icons, illustrations, and transitions were created to provide for a truly unique look, feel, and shopping experience. With such a large e-commerce app, the Raizlabs design team took great care in making sure the app’s refreshed interface stayed organized and the user experience remained intuitive.</p>
<p>“Our team was on a tight timeline to redesign B&amp;H’s Android app to coincide with the release of Lollipop in less than two months. We were able to promptly design and ship the app without losing any quality in our craftsmanship, impressing both Google’s design team and B&amp;H Photo’s users with the new look at Lollipop’s launch.” said <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/team/jon-green/">Jon Green</a>, Creative Director at Raizlabs.</p>

<p>Onstage at the Google I/O event Google’s VP of Material Design gave these final words to the Material Design Award winners:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The whole team and myself personally are just so thrilled to see you actually bring Material Design to life. The creativity, the extra sparks that you bring to your implementation of Material make it actually real and make it actually tangible....so thank you.”</p></blockquote>
