  <a title="raizlabs" href="http://www.raizlabs.com" target="_blank">Raizlabs</a> mobilized testing recently with the launch of an iPhone and iPad app for <a title="utest" href="http://www.utest.com/" target="_blank">uTest</a>, the world's largest software testing marketplace. uTest currently utilizes Flash on their website making it inaccessible to users with iOS mobile devices.  With customers spanning six continents - and 30,000+ testers spanning the globe - creating an app for the world's most popular smartphone and tablet was critical to enabling uTest’s community to stay on top of complex and dynamic global testing projects.  Raizlabs worked with uTest to create a function-rich, eye-catching, easy-to-use version of their site to provide customers and testers access wherever and whenever they need it.
