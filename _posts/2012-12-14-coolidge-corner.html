<p><img class="alignright" style="margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px" alt="Coolidge Corner" src="http://www.raizlabs.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/raizlabs_01B_nowire-300x170.jpg" width="300" height="170" />In 2003, I incorporated Raizlabs as a company out of my condo on Mason Terrace in Brookline MA.  It was as close to a garage start-up as I could get, without the garage. For the first few years I would trudge down the hill to Coolidge Corner where I would work for the day out of the Starbucks or Peet's Coffee on Harvard St. I would absorb the smells of mocha into my clothes only to trudge back up the hill at the end of the day.</p>
<p>We grew slowly during those first years, building photo software like Magic Gallery and later Pic.Me. I would head to the library to check out books on business, creating my own MBA curriculum. We watched the local pizza joint change owners three times - going from too vegetarian,  too crispy, to just right.  Coolidge Corner has the energy and a pulse that made it fun to go to work and eat lunch in one of the 50+ independent shops and restaurants within a 4 block radius.</p>
<p>We got our first real office in the S.S. Pierce building, a historic 1898 building.  Our first "real office" however was, really, a large room. We rented it from a company that was giving up the space as a secondary conference room. It was a little slice of space, but it was ours. This building has been a home away from home as we've moved through four expansions across the second floor (suites 249,225,268 and 209). We moved into mobile technology a few years back and have grown recently to the point this year where we just couldn't move to a larger space within the building.  Our departure to our new home in Boston is exciting but bitter-sweet.</p>
