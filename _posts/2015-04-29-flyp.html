<h2 style="text-align: left">from idea to reality</h2>
<p>Flyp, a startup based in Boston, partnered with Raizlabs to bring an extremely sophisticated communication app to market after being told multiple times that their vision was technically impossible.</p>
<p>They aimed to give users the unique ability to have multiple phone numbers - each with talk and text coming into a single device - affording people unique phone lines for each of the facets of their lives (work, play, dating.)</p>
<p>Flyp opted for an on-going innovation team approach, which allowed us to get started on the project immediately and left flexibility for the future as we worked through technical challenges.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left">MAKING COMPLEX SIMPLE</h2>
<p>Starting with the native phone design and adding the ability to manage communications from multiple lines on a single screen posed UX challenges. By the use of color families and icon systems, we created distinct identities for each phone line.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Now the biggest challenge rested on the shoulders of engineering; how are we going to take this experience we dreamed up and make it real?</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left">Doing the "impossible"</h2>
<p>Raizlabs engineers ingeniously devised a way to squeeze more out of the challenges imposed by the platform.</p>
<p>The result was a technical triumph that seamlessly executes multiple incoming and outbound calls from a single device; something that was previously deemed impossible. Partnering with Flyp gave us the opportunity to present an innovative solution around how people manage their complex lives.</p>
