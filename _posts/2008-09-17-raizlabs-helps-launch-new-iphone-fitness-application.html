<p>Fitnesskeeper came to Raizlabs with a vision for a technology based company focused on Fitness and Health. Raizlabs helped define a product strategy and vision for an iPhone application to allow runners to track runs using the iPhone 3G.</p>
<p>We created an end-to-end design for the application and the RunKeeper brand and then developed the iPhone portion of the product from concept to release.</p>
<p>The resulting application was one of the first iPhone applications to make use of the GPS capabilities of the phone and helped launch the startup into the health and fitness space. Learn more and download the app at <a href="http://www.runkeeper.com">www.RunKeeper.com</a></p>
