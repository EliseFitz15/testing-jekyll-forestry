<p><img align="right" src="http://www.raizlabs.com/images/picme_thumb.jpg" />Later this month Raizlabs will be in Las Vegas to release the next version of our revolutionary PicMe photo sharing product.Â  <a href="http://picme.raizlabs.com">PicMe Photo Sharing</a> will get a major upgrade resulting in a number of new features.Â  PMA2008 is the worlds largest photography conference and expo.</p>
<p>Our new software will continue to make it easier for people to share, view and discover 1000's of images right from their desktop. The new version adds the ability to work with hardware devices including digital cameras and photo frames as well as improving the core functionality of sharing and viewing photos on your own computer. PicMe is the easiest and fastest way to share photos right from your desktop.<br />
Significant improvements have been made to the plug-in system creating a one-of-a-kind photo experience working with services like Flickr and Facebook.<br />
Come see us at PMA in Las Vegas. We'll be in booth U246</p>
