<p>The combination of clock + radio has been a classic for over 50 years and now it's available for your iPhone or iPod Touch. The new application, designed and developed by Raizlabs makes use of a retro-style LCD clock display with an internet radio dial featuring over 25,000 stations.</p>

<p>While many applications for the iPhone focus on features and complex interactions, Clock Radio is designed to bring back the joy of music. The application is simple and elegant in it's design and works easily as a desktop clock or bedroom alarm. The application features free audio streams powered by Shoutcast Radio. The service is one of the largest directories of professional and community programmed online radio giving users of every taste something worth listening too.</p>
