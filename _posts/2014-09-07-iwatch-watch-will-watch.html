<p>Apple is a master at showmanship. The announcement is perfectly timed to build up anticipation for what will be their 4th major iDevice. The iPod, iPhone, and iPad followed a similar formula as early adopters formed lines around Apple stores. If the pattern holds, the iWatch will be <em>the</em> hot gift this (or next) holiday season.</p>
<h1>Why a watch?</h1>
<p>My prediction is payment. Apple is rumored to unveil a payment solution, which will allow users to pay at many point of sale locations. No need to reach for your wallet or your phone. Your payment is right on your wrist.</p>
<h1>How much?</h1>
<p>The iWatch will be priced at an affordable premium, high enough for many to wait but low enough for early adopters to reach for their wallets. The iWatch is a secondary device, so it will be lower priced than an iPhone (without a plan), but likely more expensive than an iPod touch. A price tag between $249–$349 wouldn’t be surprising.</p>
<h1>What will it do?</h1>
<p>Speculation has been pretty extensive; however, the most popular theories include: fitness tracking, biometrics, notifications, telephony, payment, and providing a secondary screen to your apps. The list of ideas is more extensive than would be possible for a first-generation product.</p>
<p>Based on Apple’s history, we can expect a small number of features done fairly well. Early competitors like Pebble and Google Wear have shown the more popular features but have failed to get any mainstream adoption.</p>
<p>Wearable sensor technology has proven to be a niche industry, and while FitBit and Jawbone have had some success, they have failed to make it into the mainstream.</p>
<p>While the iWatch may have sensors galore, its most important feature will be making a fashion statement.</p>
