  In this week's episode of AppCorner we discuss what makes a good app in light of the App Store hitting <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2013/01/07/apple-announces-40-billion-app-store-downloads-500-million-active-accounts/" target="_blank">40 billion downloads</a> (half of those downloads were made in 2012 alone.) Is it the design? The features? The marketing? We also pick and highlight our favorite apps of the year for podcast listeners.

  AppCorner is hosted by the team at Raizlabs. This week's regular podcast crew included Greg Raiz (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/graiz" target="_blank">graiz</a>), Dave Counts (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/davecounts" target="_blank">davecounts</a>), Michelle Buchman (@<a href="http://twitter.com/tres_michelle" target="_blank">tres_michelle</a>) and Nick Donaldson.
