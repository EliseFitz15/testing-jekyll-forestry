<p><strong>Brookline, MA </strong>(April 30, 2012) <strong>–</strong> <strong>Raizlabs</strong> today announced its <strong>AppBlade</strong> product has been selected as a finalist in the <strong>Best Bootstrapped Start-Up</strong> category for the MITX Innovation Awards.

<p>"The 2012 finalists represent some of the best innovators in the region, these forward-thinking companies are developing unique, new solutions to problems that are game changing," said MITX President Debi Kleiman. "We were so impressed by this group during a very competitive year, it was amazing to see the range and depth of new things being created here, and we're very proud to honor their great achievements."</p>
<p><strong>AppBlade</strong> was developed by a team of designers and developers at Raizlabs that were frustrated with the lack of great tools to manage and distribute mobile applications. Raizlabs built AppBlade because we needed a set of tools to manage, deploy and create better mobile application.  We want to create amazing tools to keep the phone personal while giving companies the tools they need to secure and manage their workforce.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to have Raizlabs nominated for Best Bootstrapped Start-Up at the MITX Innovation Awards,” said CEO and Founder Greg Raiz. “Our company has been focused on helping others navigate the mobile space. We’re excited about expanding our impact and providing companies with products like AppBlade in addition to design and development services.”  VP of Product Management Jason Petralia added, “AppBlade has been in use for over a year, and our biggest critics have been those using the tool internally in our offices. We’ve been able to create a better product in a way that would have been impossible at any company other than Raizlabs.”</p>
<p><strong>Raizlabs</strong> will be recognized with the other finalists in the category of <strong>Best Bootstrapped Start-Up</strong> at the ceremony attended by the region’s top interactive and technology professionals.
