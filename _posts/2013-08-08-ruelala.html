<h1>Redefining Mobile Shopping</h1>
<p>Rue La La is a fashion leader in the highly competitive private sale space. Every day, hundreds of thousands of shoppers storm virtual boutique doors when they open at precisely 11 AM. The company’s mobile shopping experience is key to a business built around can’t-miss-it buzz.</p>
<p>Rue La La wanted a local team in the Boston area to build an Android version of its app. What’s more, the work had to be done on an aggressive two-month timeline, just in time for back-to-school shopping season. We did it, and fans rejoiced.</p>

<h1>Skyrocking Rue la la's revenue</h1>
<p>Initially, Raizlabs was engaged to design and build an Android app to complete Rue La La’s mobile experience. Once we were finished, the bar was set so high that Rue La La signed Raizlabs on to maintain and update its entire app portfolio for iPhone, iPad and Android. Including providing ongoing consultation on mobile marketplace trends, App Store insights and user analytics.</p>
<p>Raizlabs involvement in the project dramatically improved mobile shopping performance and conversions across the platform, <strong>resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue into the new mobile business unit.</strong> In addition to a substantial increase in mobile sales, the Rue La La apps received award recognition and features in both the Apple and Google marketplaces.<br />

<h1 style="text-align: center">SO FLIPPING CONVENIENT</h1>
<p style="text-align: center">The iPad app got a fresh look to go with its ground-up rewrite. We introduced animations inspired by the page turns and bold images of fashion magazines. Not only were these delightful to use, but allowed users to shop every item available on Rue from one screen!</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center"></h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center">Shopping bag always just a swipe away.</h1>
<p style="text-align: center">We designed and implemented the "sidecart" for Rue La La iPad. This innovative cart always lived just off screen and could be navigated to quickly and easily by either swiping or tapping the shopping bag icon. We made the checkout process as easy as "Add to Bag" and "Place Order."</p>
