<p style="color: #222222;">Michelle Chen, one of our design wizards, decided it was time to give back to the design community that has been helping her since the beginning. She crafted an <a href="http://bit.ly/StiOYJ">iOS 7</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1l5r7F0">Android</a> wireframing toolkit available to anyone.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Creating wireframe sketches can be useful for laying out content and estimating how elements will fit within a screen. It gives designers an opportunity to think through an app's navigation and evaluate the overall structure of an app. They also allow designers to diagnose potential problem areas and make changes quickly before progressing to visual compositions. The fidelity of wireframes can also change depending on the client's needs.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">It is not uncommon for designers to use templates developed by other designers to begin a project. Many designers rely on these iOS and Android templates to create all kinds of mockups for apps from sketch wireframes to pixel-perfect visual compositions. Pre-made templates save designers a ton of effort and can speed up project timelines. They also help developers understand the basic direction of an app and enable them to start building its core architecture earlier.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Whether you're looking to play around with building out your app idea, or want to visually layout your designs, wireframes are essential. Without them, it would be comparable to building a house without a blueprint.</p>
