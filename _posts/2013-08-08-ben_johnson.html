<p>Ben has been building apps and thinking about mobile since the beginning of the App Store. Before Raizlabs he founded his own mobile consulting company while attending <a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu">Bowdoin College</a>. In addition to client projects, he created a breakthrough calendar app, <a href="http://www.freetimeapp.com">Free Time</a>, which was recognized by Apple as a New and Noteworthy iPhone app.</p>
<p>Having achieved a life long goal of building an app that was downloaded by more people than the population of his hometown (Jackson, Mississippi), he joined Raizlabs to help change the rest of the world through software.</p>
<p>At Raizlabs he has been involved in dozens of projects helping clients push the envelope with innovative mobile technology. Ben is also a co-organizer of Boston's premier mobile meetup, <a href="http://DrinksOnTap.org">Drinks on Tap</a> and has spoken at a variety of mobile conferences on the benefits of animations in mobile software.</p>
<p>When he isn't obsessing over how to create better products, he's either on a bike or playing Ultimate Frisbee.</p>
