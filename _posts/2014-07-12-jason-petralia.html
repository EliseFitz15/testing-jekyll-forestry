<p>After time abroad at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and graduating from Tulane University, Jason was left with a keen interest in the development of transformative technologies.  He’s since balanced this interest with additional years abroad developing fresh insights on business, life and software.</p>
<p>Stateside again, Jason has driven technology and growth for leading software companies such as Experian where he helped leading organizations successfully integrate and utilize data centric technology to improve overall efficiency.With the ascendance of the smartphone, Jason dropped everything to build an independent mobile technology studio and has since produced dozens of mobile applications and technologies.  Jason proudly submitted his first iPhone application while traveling to Cuzco, Peru and has remained passionate about the proliferation of mobile technology since then.</p>
<p>With well over a dozen mobile apps under his belt, Jason joined Raizlabs where he remains focused on pushing mobile development to the next level.</p>
