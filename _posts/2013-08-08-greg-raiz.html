<p>Greg Raiz founded Raizlabs in 2003 with a vision to improve lives through technology and design. The company has grown substantially over the last decade and is viewed as a leader in the Boston and SF technology, web, and mobile communities.</p>
<p>Greg graduated Tufts University and got his start at Microsoft as a program manager on Windows XP. He moved back to Boston and founded Raizlabs with a focus on user experience and product design. For the first four years, Raizlabs concentrated on designing interfaces for web applications. Then, in 2007, Apple released the iPhone:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The iPhone was the perfect platform for us. We had spent years crafting experiences and designing software. Here was a platform that not only made it easy, but made it fun.” - Gregory Raiz</p></blockquote>
<p>Our first mobile apps launched within a month of the AppStore unveiling, rocketing to the top of the charts.</p>
<p>Greg is active in the mobile, web, and design community, in Boston, SF and beyond. He founded <a href="http://DrinksOnTap.org">DrinksOnTap.org</a> and <a href="http://www.altconf.com">AltConf</a> and has spoken on technology at many universities and events including MIT, MobileMonday, Harvard Business School, Bentley, and Olin, as well as for companies like Microsoft, Fidelity, Staples and others. He has served on the boards of <a href="http://www.bostonchi.org/">BostonCHI</a> and the usability group, <a href="http://uxpaboston.org/">UXPA Boston</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Greg is currently growing Raizlabs and working with technology leaders across the country on their mobile and web strategies.</strong></p>
