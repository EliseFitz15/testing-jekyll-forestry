<p>In this week's episode of AppCorner the team discusses "getting in the zone", Apple's tendency/foresight to hold back on features, how to hide a body (with Siri's help), and everyone's favorite app of the week.</p>
<p>AppCorner is hosted by Ben Johnson (@scoober). The usual crew includes Greg Raiz (@graiz), Justin Kaufman (@j_kauf), Dave Counts (@davecounts) and Joe Goullaud (@jgoullaud). This week Michele Titolo (@micheletitolo) joined us so that Joe could "stay in the zone".</p>
