<p>B&amp;H Photo, the largest privately-owned photo and video store in the United States, is widely known as the first stop for purchasing photography and video equipment. This year, B&amp;H sought to build an innovative app for iPad to satisfy their growing mobile audience. After seeing Raizlabs’ previous leading-edge e-commerce (five-star apps for similar high-level retailers like Rue La La, Macy's Herald Square, and Bloomingdale's 59th and Lex), a partnership between the two companies was a natural fit.</p>
<p>Available today, the B&amp;H Photo app for iPad establishes a new precedent for mobile commerce, offering customers a unique way to browse B&amp;H’s expansive and diverse portfolio of products.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It has definitely been an exciting project, and we’ve come away with some really neat elements under the hood,”</p>
<p>Senior Developer Nick Donaldson remarked.</p></blockquote>
<p>Raizlabs set out to develop a more intuitive browsing experience. A new way of browsing by category allows for a swift way to explore B&amp;H’s enormous catalog of items. “Introducing a method to easily refine searches allows for a more engaging app experience,” Raizlabs Creative Director Jon Green observed.  “A living ‘table of contents’ is always just an edge swipe away.”</p>

(Go ahead, add that new DSLR you eyed for months to your shopping cart.) You might see an animation of B&amp;H’s famous conveyor belt system from their flagship NYC SuperStore.</p>
<p>“We’re very excited about our new iPad app and look forward to seeing it out in the wild,” said Eli Weiss, Mobile Commerce Manager at B&amp;H. “The innovative search and browsing functionality of the app will really set it apart and give our customers the quality experience they deserve.”</p>
<p>Be sure to download the new B&amp;H Photo Video application, available today in the Apple Store.</p>
