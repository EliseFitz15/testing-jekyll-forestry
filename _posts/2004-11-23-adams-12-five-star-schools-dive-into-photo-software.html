<p><strong>Brookline, MA November 23, 2004</strong> - Raizlabs Corporation today announced that the Adams 12 Five Star School District of Colorado has purchased licenses to the company's new Magic Gallery photo software. This licensing agreement marks the first implementation of Magic Gallery software in the classroom, in an effort to make digital software and photography easier to use for teachers and students alike.</p>
<p>The software will be installed in all 48 of the districtâ€™s schools, making it possible for students and teachers to collaboratively update their web sites with photos and art projects. Magic Gallery software was chosen for its simplicity and ease of use. The software makes it easy to take digital photos and have them instantly published to a web site.</p>
<p>Gregory Raiz, President of Raizlabs, says "We wanted to give schools not only the easiest photo software available, but also the most affordable. We donated one fifth of the software used in this project and worked to make this educational version very accessible. We worked closely with Adams 12 to make sure that everything was as simple to use as possible."</p>
<p>Adams 12, in their search for the perfect photo publishing software, evaluated a number of solutions before deciding on Magic Gallery. <em>Bryan Friberg, Sr. Programmer Analyst for Adams 12 says, "Magic Gallery is the perfect, easy, low-cost tool that our art teachers needed to quickly post student artwork. It processes graphics, creates sites, menu's and thumbnails without asking too many questions or providing too many options...we expect the majority of our art teachers to be successful with little or no training."<br />
