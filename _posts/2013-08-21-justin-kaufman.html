<p>Justin joined Raizlabs before mobile was cool. Since then, he's contributed mobile expertise to dozens of clients including mobile pioneers RunKeeper and Localytics. His code has been downloaded literally billions of times from the App Store.</p>
<p>After three and a half years with Raizlabs, Justin departed for Apple to improve OS X accessibility for persons with disabilities. Now he's back on team <span style="background-color: #ec594d;color: #ffffff"> Raizlabs </span>, heading up West Coast engineering.</p>
<p>Justin also organizes the San Francisco chapter of <a href="http://www.DrinksOnTap.org/SF">DrinksOnTap</a> and presents on mobile design and development. On weekends, you can find him wandering San Francisco slaying fog.</p>
