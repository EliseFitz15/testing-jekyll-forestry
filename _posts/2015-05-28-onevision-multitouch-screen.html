<h2 style="text-align: left">Innovating New Digital Frontiers</h2>
<p style="text-align: left">OneVision, a managed services provider, came to Raizlabs with a client's dream of converting their analog, paper maps to a digital, interactive interface - Minority Report-style. Together we conceptualized a high-definition digital interface that was simple enough to be used with one hand but comprehensive enough to include everything their paper maps delivered and more. </p>
<p style="text-align: left">As an early partner, Raizlabs played a key role in identifying the technology used in the project - from the latest Mac Pro to the latest 4K display technology, we performed thorough feasibility tests to ensure that the end result we all wanted was possible.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left">multi-touch screen design</h2>
<p>We had to think about designing and architecting for a new paradigm â€“ the giant screen. The mobile gestures we are all familiar with provided a strong foundation to start, but expanding them to life-size movements created the challenge of accommodating multiple people all engaging with the app at once. Raizlabs overcame this challenge by developing software as efficient as it was elegant, bridging the gap between a custom user experience and hardware resources.</p>
