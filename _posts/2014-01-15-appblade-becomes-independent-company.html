<p>Raizlabs is proud to announce AppBlade officially became an independent company earlier this week.</p>
<p>Raizlabs created <a href="https://appblade.com">AppBlade</a>, a mobile device management platform, about three years ago as an internal tool. Its logo resembles a Swiss Army knife, for its innovative tools and abilities to help companies deploy and manage mobile devices in the most efficient way.</p>

<p>Former Raizlabs lead developer, James Daniels, will be leading AppBlade.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>"AppBlade has changed considerably since those early days and I'm excited to be leading Raizlabs' first spin-off," Daniels said.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Raizlabs founder Gregory Raiz will not be bidding adieu to AppBlade completely, since he will be involved as a member of its board.</p>
<p>"I'm super excited about the mobile device management space and I believe AppBlade is well positioned to succeed here," Raiz said. "Over the past several months it has grown to a feature set that we felt would succeed and grow faster as its own company."</p>
<p>Daniels has begun to form his team, and said he e<span style="line-height: 1.5;">xpects AppBlade won't be the last "skunkworks" project from the magicians on Milk Street.</span></p>
