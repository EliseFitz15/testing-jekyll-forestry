<p>We’re excited to announce the Raizlabs XLR8 class of 2015!</p>
<p>XLR8 is what we’re calling our brand new in-house startup incubator, and this is the first cohort. The startups we’re incubating range the gamut and have been birthed out of Harvard, street protests in Chile, a desire for a healthier society, and the general aspiration to solve problems with technology.</p>
<h1>How &amp; why this all started</h1>
<p>We’ve grown rapidly in the last year (we were named <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2015/03/12/boston-business-journal-unveils-2015-pacesetters.html">Massachusetts’ 16th fastest growing private company</a> in 2014), and knew we needed to move into a new office space to accommodate the explosive growth. Eight months ago we were shopping around for a new home for Raizlabs, and we found a beautiful space right on the same block as our old office. Score!</p>
<p>We locked down the entire 19th floor as the new home for Raizlabs (which I think may have the most beautiful view in all of Boston), and all we had to do was move in. By securing an entire floor as our new home, we were accounting for future growth of our core business: <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/">mobile app development</a> for <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/work/">startups and Fortune 500 companies</a>. Despite this, we knew it would be a while before the entire office was occupied by Raizlabers and that we’d have a lot of empty space at the beginning.</p>

<p>Having half of the office empty just felt like a lost opportunity. We kicked around a few ideas — I think a ball pit and roller derby were even brought up at one point.</p>
<p>We decided to put our expertise, talent, and knowledge to good use: we started an incubator for startups that were focused on mobile. What better way make use of all the space in our new home? (I think the ball pit would’ve been better, but hey startups are fun too!)</p>

<h1>The Raizlabs XLR8 Incubator</h1>
<p>We wanted to support mobile-focused startups, but we wanted to do it differently than most other incubators and accelerators. Our incubator is entirely product and team focused, and we provide everything a startup needs except for a cash investment. You can read more about how our <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/services/startup-incubator/">mobile startup incubator</a> is different here.</p>
<h1>Some Numbers</h1>
<p>We formally announced the incubator in mid-February, and then left about 6 weeks for startups to apply. Our Founder &amp; CEO, <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/team/greg-raiz/">Greg Raiz</a>, was very hands on during this process and personally screened each startup that applied.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<h3>
<li><span style="color: #ec594d"><strong>41</strong></span> startups applied by the April 1st deadline.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ec594d">13</span></strong> were invited to pitch in front of our team.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ec594d">11</span></strong> ended up pitching at Pitch Day.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ec594d">7</span></strong> startups were invited to be part of our first cohort.</li>
</h3>
</ul>
<p><strong>All 7 startups have accepted</strong>, and will be joining us this summer!</p>
<hr />
<p>We will also have an Entrepreneur in Residence on site that will be exploring ideas for potential ventures and providing assistance to the startups.</p>
<h1>How we judged Pitch Day</h1>
<p>The 11 startups that came in to pitch were judged on the normal business aspects of a new venture. We are very culture-focused here at Raizlabs and we wanted to make sure these companies were a great fit, so we also judged startups based on our Core Values.</p>
<hr />
<h1>The Raizlabs Core Values</h1>
<ul>
<li>Take <span style="color: #ec594d"><strong>pride</strong></span> in our work</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ec594d">Push</span></strong> the envelope</li>
<li>Deliver experiences that <strong><span style="color: #ec594d">impact</span></strong> people's lives</li>
<li>Have fun working as a <strong><span style="color: #ec594d">team</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>After Pitch Day we took the weekend to digest everything, and had then an internal discussion on each startup. The Raizlabs leadership team was (independently) on the same page with each other about the startups. This made deciding which companies to accept quite easy.</p>
