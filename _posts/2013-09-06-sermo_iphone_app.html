<h1 class="highlight">Revolutionizing Patient Care</h1>
<p>Sermo, the largest online physician community in the United States, was looking for a way to empower its network of physicians to collaborate on difficult cases and exchange observations about drugs, devices and clinical issues on a mobile platform.<br />

<h1>Getting Results</h1>
<p>The new iConsult app allows any doctor with a smartphone to put its camera and the community to work for better diagnostics and education. The app helped Sermo further revolutionize the way physicians collaborate to improve patient care.</p>
<h1>How it Happened</h1>
<p>Raizlabs designed and developed iConsult, which is essentially an iPhone version of the Sermo (Latin for “conversation”) site. One of the key features of the app is its ability to take a picture of an interesting case and upload it to the community for a consultation.<br />

<h1>A Prescription for Success</h1>
<p>Say your family doctor is stumped by your son’s rash. The doctor pulls out her iPhone, snaps a photo, taps a couple of buttons to pose a pre-composed question and then selects the Dermatology category. Within seconds, a dermatologist (or any doctor) in the Sermo community can see the photo and offer assistance. Suddenly, your son is able to get care not just from your doctor, but several physicians across the country.<br />
