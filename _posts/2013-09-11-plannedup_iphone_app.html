<h1>First, We Joined Their Event</h1>
<p>plannedUp began as a startup that aims to make personal calendars more social. They turned to Raizlabs to handle the mobile version of their service, only to discover through working with us that the mobile platform should be their focus, rather than the web.<br />

<h1>Getting Results</h1>
<p>Raizlabs helped introduce the key thing missing from the schedules we keep on our phones: social calendaring. This was the natural evolution of digital calendars for the Facebook generation, for whom seeing all events in their social network is still a unique challenge.</p>
<h1>Confirming Plans</h1>
<p>We worked with plannedUp to envision and build a mobile social calendar, incorporating the app user's own schedule alongside a news feed of friends' events.<br />

<h2>RSVPs for the 21st Century</h2>
<p>With full Facebook, calendar and address book integration, users can see everything that their friends are planning, comment on events and join in. There is also a "secret" setting so users can choose to keep parts of their calendars private.<br />
