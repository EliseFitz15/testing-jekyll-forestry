<p>“We love embracing new technologies like Google Wallet and pushing the envelope for the companies we work with. Both Google &amp; Rue have been great to work with and we’re very excited about this release," said, Gregory Raiz, CEO of Raizlabs.</p>
<p>Raizlabs has worked with Rue La La on their award-winning iOS and Android products since 2010, bringing great styles to pockets and purses nationwide. Rue La La was named the 2012 Mobile Merchandiser of the Year by Mobile Commerce Daily and now currently accounts for approximately 40% of Rue’s total revenue.</p>
<p>The newest edition of the Android app now allows millions of users with Google Wallet accounts to checkout with ease. Customers can now simply click the "Buy with Google" button for straightforward, easy checkout experience. In addition, through the Google Wallet app users can also view all their past purchasing history in one place for added convenience.</p>
<p>“The Android App has been redesigned and rebuilt from the ground floor up. We’re really pleased with the results,” said Mike Putnam, VP of Mobile at Rue La La. “We’re excited to be a launch partner for Wallet on Android at Google I/O. Mobile is the cornerstone of our business, we are committed to leadership in the market, and Raizlabs has been an excellent partner for us.”</p>
<p>For Rue La La, adding Wallet integration was a no-brainer. Not only is this a much better experience for existing users, but it makes it even easier to quickly find and purchase products.</p>
<p>“The team at Rue La La were great to work with” noted Android Developer Joe Mahon. “The bold design of the Android app really sets the app apart from others in the Play Store.” Joe went on to say, “In this project we did a great job combining the flat Android theming with Rue La La’s sense of style. I can’t wait to see the response garnered from Google I/O.”</p>
<p>Mobile commerce is the future of retail and technologies like Google Wallet can bring that future to us even faster. The new Android app with Google Wallet integration will be available for download in the Google Play Store.</p>
