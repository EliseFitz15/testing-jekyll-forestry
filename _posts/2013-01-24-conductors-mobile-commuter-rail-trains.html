  The Massachusetts Bay Commuter Railroad is unveiling a new program that will make real-time commuter rail information available to conductors for the first time. The application, developed by Raizlabs for the MBCR, provides real-time updates on all commuter rail lines including location, speed and track assignment of trains.

<p>The Massachusetts Bay Commuter Railroad is unveiling a new program that will make real-time commuter rail information available to conductors for the first time.

The “<em><strong>Conductor Companion</strong></em>” app will be given to 24 conductors outfitted with an iPhone running the app. Later this year, MBCR plans to roll out the program to over 200 additional conductors. The Massachusetts commuter rail system is the first in the country to give their conductors real-time access to train information.</p>
<p>Using MBCR's GPS tracking data, the application gives crews updates such as train location, speed, track assignments, service interruptions and safety bulletins. “The ‘Conductor Companion’ program leverages the power of mobile technology and will improve the quality of information that our customers receive," said MBCR General Manager Hugh Kiley. “MBCR crews will now be able to better communicate delays, service interruptions and other information directly to customers as events unfold.”</p>
<p>"We're excited to be the MBCR’s choice for a first of its kind app," Raizlabs Product Manager Ben Johnson remarked. "As MBCR ridership continues to grow, mobile technology allows conductors to better anticipate customers needs."</p>
