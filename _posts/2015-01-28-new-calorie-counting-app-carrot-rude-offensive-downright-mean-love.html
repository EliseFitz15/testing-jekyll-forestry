<p class="p1">The folks at Carrot have a whole suite of apps ingeniously corralled off into a family of products with the same concept, tone, and art direction. The premise is this: An artificial intelligence is living in your smartphone. It’s watching you and your every horrible decision. It’s got disdain for the human race so it bullies you into being a better person with insults, jeering, and jabs not unlike your personal wolf-pack. These are my kind of productivity apps. And they should be yours too.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Carrot's new calorie counting app.</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>I took the newest of the bunch, CARROT's calorie counting app </strong><a title="Carrot Hunger Calorie Counting App" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/carrot-hunger-talking-calorie/id912570794?mt=8" target="_blank"><em>CARROT Hunger - The Talking Calorie Counting App</em></a>, on a test drive this week and I'm blown away. From a psychological sense it works. I’m entertained. I want to see what Carrot’s going to say when I please it - and more so, when I upset it. </span></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_7257" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-15-at-10.47.49-PM.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-7257" src="http://www.raizlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-15-at-10.47.49-PM-1024x296.png" alt="The full suite of CARROT productivy apps" width="756" height="219" /></a> The full suite of CARROT productivity apps[/caption]</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Make sure you’ve got the audio on because so much of the humor hits harder with the robo-voice.</strong> You’re onboarded with some healthy quips mirroring the sales message. You enter your personal information about your weight, age, and height and it calculates a daily allotment for calories for you to consume, but not exceed. You tell Carrot what you've consumed after every meal by searching through a database powered by the <a title="Nutritionix" href="http://www.nutritionix.com/api" target="_blank">Nutritionix API</a> and it adds it all up. As you enter each item, it gives you a real world activity you're going to have to do to negate the effects.</p>
<p class="p1">For instance, if you tell Carrot you’ve consumed a Nutrageos bar, it tells you you’re going to have to walk 3.1 miles to counteract your transgression. It really makes you think twice. I personally made better decisions about what I ate just because it was top of mind. We'll see if that sticks.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_2370.png"><img class="wp-image-7270" src="http://www.raizlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_2370-577x1024.png" alt="You'll need to bike!" width="229" height="406" /></a>  <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_2393.png"><img class="wp-image-7271" src="http://www.raizlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_2393-577x1024.png" alt="Fun copy everywhere in this thing." width="229" height="406" /></a>  <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_2352.png"><img class="wp-image-7267" src="http://www.raizlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_2352-577x1024.png" alt="Yeah, your avatar does a little Shakespeare while you're idol." width="229" height="406" /></a></p>
<p><em>You'll need to bike! Fun copy everywhere in this thing. Your avatar does a little Shakespeare while you're idle. </em></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">It works the other way too. If you’re exercising, you can tell your new A.I. overlord you've hit the gym and she'll (yes, it's a she) knock back your calorie count.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The copywriting is brilliant.</strong> The consistent tone of a race of robot overlords whipping the human race into shape persists through every communication.  Every prompt, selfless promotion, notification, threat, and ad (yes, ads) is funny. It cross-markets the rest of the family of apps in logical and welcome ways too.</p>
<p>[gallery link="none" columns="2" size="medium" ids="7273,7274,7275,7260,7263,7261"]</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The design choices are not entirely intuitive.</strong> The cancel button while you're entering calories is not where you'd expect it. Even after a week of use I wasn't fully trained to cancel the action and return to my home screen without multiple glances and searches for a button that should be in the upper left. (hint-it's in the center of the screen under the calorie entry field)</p>
<p class="p1">But I know what they're doing. They've mistakenly decided to put recent caloric entries across the top for ease of use just like iOS 8's "recent" contacts area. I get that. The problem is that in iOS you always know the "home" button can bail you out of any task. So there's no need to give you a cancel button always. Here in Carrot though, that same action - the users default when no "cancel" or "x" is present, bounces you out of the app. It's pretty annoying.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s talk about the “Robot ad network”.</p>
<p></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Carrot feeds you a regular mix of display ads. They appear at the bottom of the screen in typical, “I’m going to ignore you” fashion. But I couldn’t ignore them. They're brutally funny at times. </span></p>
<p class="p1">I’m an ad guy at heart and I relentlessly critique the craft. In mobile though, 99% of the time I’m like every other user - I avoid and ignore them at all costs. Carrot’s a different story.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>I found myself hanging out on the main screen many times waiting to see what wacky message was going to be served up next.</strong> Not because they’ve partnered with actual services and goods I’m interested in, but because they’ve got a ton of fake ads they serve up in the same placements - All perpetuating the hilarious fiction they’ve created.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Here are a few of my favorites and the payoff when you’ve taken the bait. (tapped on it)</span></strong></p>
<p>[gallery link="none" size="medium" columns="2" ids="7264,7265,7269,7268"]</p>
<p>There are so many funny details baked into this experience that you’re only going to get it if you actually take the time to download and spend some time with it. Do yourself a favor and subject yourself to the abuse.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">In conclusion, it's an awesome product.</span></h2>
<p>We all know there's a boatload of calorie counting apps out there, but this product stands out above the rest because it has <em>personality</em>. It's not boring.<strong> <a title="Carrot Hunger Calorie Counting App" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/carrot-hunger-talking-calorie/id912570794?mt=8" target="_blank"><em>CARROT Hunger - The Talking Calorie Counting App</em></a> is a great example of how sweating the details makes for a delightful product that people want to talk about and will pay for.</strong> The experience is immersive. It successfully sucks you in with humor and creativity enough to let minor off-kilter design issues slide. Pain points can be overlooked and the good outweighs the bad.</p>
<p>And even folks that can't stand in-app ads or marketing messages disrupting their use of their tools will delight in the holistic and thoughtful ways the folks at Carrot have devised to make the necessary evils of the app world fun and sticky.</p>
