<p>Many companies want to innovate, but rarely are they willing to commit the necessary time, money and resources to the effort. To make time for innovation there needs to be a structure and dedicated outlets for that creativity.<br />
Innovation is nothing new, Atlassian (Jira, Bitbucket, Confluence) hosts Fedex days, named so after the idea of “shipping” software or finishing a project. Google has what they call 20% time for innovation. In fact, the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/innovative-companies/list/#tab:rank">Forbes list of most innovative companies</a> is filled with examples. Just as important as setting time aside to start a project, it is equally important to have the organizational support to finish it. At Raizlabs we wanted to explore our version.</p>
<p>Everyone wants to make stuff that matters, but it comes down to having the structure and freedom to do so. At Raizlabs, we've integrated innovation into our workflow, we call it <strong><a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/company/jobs/hack-days/">Hackday</a>.</strong> It happens every other Friday, tied into our existing agile &amp; scrum process.  The team uses hackdays, 10% time to work on projects that interest individuals personally and help the company as a whole grow.</p>

<p>In April, a few developers came up with the idea for a simple game called Circle. The point of the game would be to gain sides and eventually transform into a circle. They then added a designer, musicians and others to join them to polish the game and bring it to market. Months later we are super excited to be shipping <a href="http://www.supermassiveapp.com/">Supermassive</a>, an immersive space shooter. <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/supermassive3-copy.png"><br />

<p>Why a game? A lot of the best innovations happen when you’re having fun. Hackday is used to spark creativity and exploration. Games provide a canvas to explore technology from 3D, audio, graphics, physics and more. Games also provide user interface designers more flexibility with non-conventional design patterns and wouldn’t be as easy to test within traditional products.</p>

<p>Hackdays don’t have to be all about shipping a product, but they should have a profound impact on your company.  We’ve been having hackdays for several years and have produced internal mobile innovations that have helped make our products, designs, and teams better. Not every innovation is visible, but every innovation is driven bottom-up, not to down.</p>
<p>Hack day projects are designed as a creative outlet for mobile innovation and allow us to explore genres, programs, and techniques that interest us and cultivate our skills and knowledge.  Hackdays aim is to lower the barrier to creating something great. The lack of process eliminates some of the red-tape that can occur as companies grow. Hackday innovation is about saying yes. When someone asks you to work on something that gets you excited, SAY YES! By doing so you inject your company with entrepreneurship, passion, and positive energy.</p>
<p>In designing Supermassive, we were able to explore many different styles without limitation.  Designers and developers worked side-by-side, solving problems as a group through sketches and iterative collaboration. Our process allowed for some great collaborations and ultimately made a better product because we played to our strengths. These types of explorations led to better team communication and collaboration for non-hack days.</p>
