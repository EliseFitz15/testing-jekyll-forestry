<p><strong>Matt K. from Qatar (Username: AlbertZ) - 876,224 miles traveled this year</strong></p>
<p>Matt is a pilot who flies exclusively internationally. His travels have taken him to all six continents. "I most enjoy returning to Europe. Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, Australia, the US and Canada are a few of my other favorite travel spots," he said. Matt lives in a very small country, so his weekly schedule varies greatly with international flights. "Sometimes they are very short 30 minute flights or they can be 17 hours long. Usually I fly two long flights a week, four medium ones or 20 short ones. I have found that it's not always the longest trips that give you the most miles in a week, because you tend to have a greater period of rest before and after taking those," he added.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Glen C. from Denver, Colorado (Username: ParrotHead) - 677,078 miles this year</strong></p>
<p>Glen, a pilot with a major U.S. air carrier is a huge Jimmy Buffet fan, hence his "ParrotHead" username on Jetsetter. "I travel all over to see him," he recounted. "This past summer I caught his show in Paris on a layover between flights." He likes using the app because "It keeps track of the miles I've flown and my kids can see. They think it's pretty cool! I point out on the map where I have been since I've been gone."  Some of Glen's favorite travel spots include Amsterdam, London, Dublin, Stockholm, Berlin, Hong Kong, Guam and Sao Paulo. A few places still remain on his list of places to fly such as Africa, India and Russia. The average work week varies, but "I usually work a block of 10 days on, then 7-10 off. 95% of my trips are international because domestic trips on a 757/767 jet are non-productive and I would be awarded less days off if I flew domestic," he explained.</p>

<p>You can use Jetsetter to track your own world travels and miles flown. Users can set up groups and compete against their friends to see who treks the greatest distance around the globe. Download the application in the App Store and see among your friends who can rack up the most miles.</p>
