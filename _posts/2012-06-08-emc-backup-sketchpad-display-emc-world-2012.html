<p>The application was on display in the EMC Backup Freedom booth and received overwhelmingly positive praise. EMC employees used the app as a simple way to have a visual discussion about the customers’ backup environment and possible EMC solutions to solve their challenges.  One EMC employee remarked, “The iPad application was an extremely effective tool to walk customers through their current environment and how EMC Backup and Recovery Solutions can integrate and solve their challenges. It was very easy and intuitive to use and allowed for free flowing conversations to be had. In addition to the prebuilt templates, the ability to save and email the end results/drawing was perfect. Customers loved it. I can see this application becoming a valuable part of my toolbox as a pre-sales engineer. It will save a lot of napkins at lunch meetings!”</p>
<p>Raizlabs VP of Product Jason Petralia noted, "EMC is truly an innovative partner. The quality of EMC Backup Sketchpad is no accident in thanks to the dedicated efforts of both teams." The application proved to be so popular that EMC received requests from employees to make the sketchpad app available for use in the field. Raizlabs is currently working with EMC to distribute EMC Backup SketchPad for wider use.</p>
