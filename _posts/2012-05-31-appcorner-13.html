<p>In this week's episode of AppCorner we talk with one of our developers as he defends his Facebook stock purchase, discuss the possibility/speculation about a potential Facebook phone, iPhone 5 and WWDC announcement rumors, and share our new favorite Tumblr - <a href="http://textfromxcode.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Text from Xcode</a>.
