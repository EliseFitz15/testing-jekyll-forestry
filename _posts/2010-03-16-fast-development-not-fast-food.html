<p>BOSTON, Massachusetts (March 15, 2010) - Raizlabs announces that its latest iPhone app, Boston Restaurant Week 2010, is now available in the iTunes store less than a week after development began.  <a id="more"></a><a id="more-5373"></a>Boston Restaurant Week features the addresses, locations (by street address and GPS coordinates) and event menus of all 207 participating restaurants. It even places a call for reservations or offers directions at the press of a button.  The Boston Restaurant Week app sells for $0.99, the minimum price in Apple's tiered pricing system.  Boston's Restaurant week is March 14-19 &amp; 20-25, 2010.</p>
<p>Raizlabs developed a content framework enabling developer Justin Kaufman and designer Dave Counts to begin working on the app on a Tuesday and submit the app for approval by Apple before 5PM the following Friday. “I was in New York on Monday demonstrating features of RZContent to publishers when I got an email from Justin about getting started," said Counts. "Even with an imminent and absolute deadline, the framework let us keep business hours, not developer hours."</p>
<p>Raizlabs founder Greg Raiz first suggested the project at a morning meeting on Friday, March 5. “We kicked it around," said Raiz, "But everyone's schedule was already full. Ultimately, we decided that's what made it a perfect test for the framework. It's supposed to make development fast and easy."</p>
<p>"The great unknown was Apple's approval cycle," said Kaufman. “If Apple didn't approve the app, and quickly, it would have been more an exercise than a product. “Fortunately, we've shipped enough apps to know how to avoid rejection and our reputation probably expedited things."</p>
<p>Boston Restaurant Week is available in the app store on iTunes for $0.99:</p>
