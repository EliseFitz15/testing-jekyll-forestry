<h1>Seeking Secure Access from Anywhere</h1>
<p>Nasuni is a data storage company that combines on-premise hardware with cloud storage, delivering a better storage experience for remote enterprise IT teams while reducing their costs. We worked with Nasuni to create a mobile app that gives their users access to all of their files via iPhone, iPad, and Android.</p>

<h1>Getting Results</h1>
<p>Nasuni Mobile benefits IT teams by offering complete security. The app is fully integrated into the existing systems that Nasuni builds for its distributed enterprise clients, leading to increased customer satisfaction across the board.</p>
<h1>Making Security Simple</h1>
<p>Enterprise storage has unique challenges in terms of volume, functionality and security, so we took a careful look at Nasuni's requirements before diving into design. We came out with a thoughtfully developed app that gets the job done for secure files of all types.<br />
