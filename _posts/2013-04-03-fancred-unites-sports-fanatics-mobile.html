<p>Fancred is a new social app founded by Kash Razzaghi, Jeremy Merle, Michael Pan and Craig Johnson and developed by Raizlabs that measures the life of a sports fan and provides a personalized way to communicate, discover, and consume your favorite sports content. Users can follow their favorite teams and post in feeds devoted to those specific teams. Watching the big playoff game? Hang out with others doing the same by sharing links, posting images or GIFs, and up or down-voting others posts in your sports feed. The application serves as an alternative to message boards or comment threads on websites, instead presenting sports discussion in a well-designed and easy to digest mobile interface.</p>
<p>Over 1700 users have registered in the first week of launch, and the number is only expected to grow. Fancred also garnered a spot in the Top 25 of the Sports category in the App Store. The application has earned five stars from the 120+ users reviews written so far.</p>
<p>“Fancred was a very fun app to be a part of. It fell under the category of a project you can envision people using, which makes the development process even more rewarding as you see the final product come together.” said developer Josh Leibsly.</p>
<p>Be sure to join the community of sports fans developing on Fancred and download the app today.</p>
