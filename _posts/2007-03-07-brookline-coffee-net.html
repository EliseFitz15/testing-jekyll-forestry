<p>Raizlabs has recently setup a wireless hot spot in Coolidge Corner. The hotspot powered by <a href="http://www.fon.com/en/">Fon.com</a> allows visitors to purchase low cost day passes for wireless access. Located on the corner of Beacon St. and Harvard St. the wireless network is visible and available to people visiting both Peet's coffee and Starbucks.</p>
