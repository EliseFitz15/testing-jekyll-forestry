<p dir="ltr">Raizlabs is ramping up to launch our in house mobile game, Supermassive, and we want you to try it out! We designed and built Supermassive at Raizlabs during our internal <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/company/jobs/hack-days/">Hack Days</a>. The game will soon be in the App Store as a free download.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Supermassive takes inspiration from retro arcade shooter games like Asteroids. As a triangle, you shoot enemy shapes to destroy them and absorb their mass.  As you gain mass, you also gain more sides, offering more corners to shoot from.  When you reach 8 sides, you transform into a black hole and devour the universe.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We are also working to make the app universal, including porting it to Apple TV, and hope to have it ready for the holidays. Please sign up to be notified when it's ready.  <a href="http://www.supermassiveapp.com/" target="_blank">http://www.supermassiveapp.com</a></p>
