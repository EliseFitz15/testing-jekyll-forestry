<p style="text-align: left">Today we released a new version of our Tip Calculator application.  To date we've had over 100,000 downloads. Most of these have been for the bargin price of $0.99.  The new version updates the look and feel of the application, giving it the nicer calculator keyboard look and feel.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">What sets our tip calculator apart from other similar tools is how easy it makes it to split the bill between many people. The built in adjustment tool allows users to simply use a slider to adjust their contributions.   <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/software/apps/tip_calculator">Additional download information can be found here. </a></p>
