  Raizlabs Corporation is pleased to announce the release of VideoUp, the world's first video upload app for Facebook. Now you can share video from your iPhone on Facebook, where friends and family will see it instantly. VideoUp is the easiest way to get video from your iPhone 3GS to Facebook without a computer. Simply log-in to Facebook, select a video (or record a new one), and add an optional description. The application does the rest.

  Gregory Raiz, founder of Raizlabs adds: "Our team really knocked this out. We developed the application in a day and a half. The very first day that the iPhone 3GS was released, we had the application built. It took us another day of testing and working with the team at Facebook to resolve some technical issues. We're excited to have the application launched and to be the first tool to offer video support for Facebook and iPhone 3GS users."

  When video uploading was enabled for YouTube using the new iPhone uploads shot up 400% a day with a cumulative rise of over 1700%. The new VideoUp application will enable similar explosive growth on the Facebook side. To date Apple has announced that over a million iPhones 3GS phones have been sold.
