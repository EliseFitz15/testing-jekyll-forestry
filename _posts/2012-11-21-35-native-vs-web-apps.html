  In this week's episode of AppCorner we chat about the debate of web (HTML5, normally the same code used to distrbute the app across platforms/devices) applications vs. native (developed for use on a particular platform such as iOS or Android). We cite Facebook as an example - they <a href="http://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/under-the-hood-rebuilding-facebook-for-ios/10151036091753920" target="_blank">recently switched from an HTML5 web app to a native application</a>. Of course, we also recommend our picks (or deletions) for app of the week!

  AppCorner is hosted by the team at Raizlabs. This week's regular podcast crew included Greg Raiz (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/graiz" target="_blank">graiz</a>), Dave Counts (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/davecounts" target="_blank">davecounts</a>), Joe Goullaud (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/jgoullaud" target="_blank">jgoullaud</a>) and Michelle Buchman (@<a href="http://twitter.com/tres_michelle" target="_blank">tres_michelle</a>).

Apps and other cool things discussed in this weeks podcast include:</p>
<ul>

(works in 28 cities including NYC, Toronto, Montreal, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, Vancouver, Washington DC, Philadelphia). Wherever you are, just pull Transit out of your pocket and quickly see the next departure for all the public transit routes near you, in order of proximity.</li>

<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pop-prototyping-on-paper/id555647796?mt=8" target="_blank">POP (Prototyping on Paper)</a> - Complicated wireframing tools slow us down. Why not use the most efficient tools, pen &amp; paper, to create prototypes?That's why we make POP. You simply take pictures of your wireframe, link these pictures, and it'll work on iPhone! It's great for professional designers. You can import your mockup images made with Photoshop or Fireworks, link them in POP, and they'll look like the real thing. It's also great for anyone with an app idea. When you take pictures of paper prototypes, POP will automatically brighten up your images to make them more legible on screen. When you're done, share your prototypes with friends and colleagues to get feedback.</li>

<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/plex/id383457673?mt=8" target="_blank">Plex</a> - lex for iOS brings the power of Plex to your iPad, iPhone or iPod touch. With Plex, you can stream your music, videos and photos from your home computers running Plex Media Server (available from <a href="http://www.plexapp.com/" target="_blank">http://www.plexapp.com/</a>) and access content from a wide range of channels. Channels are available for apps like Aperture, iTunes and iPhoto, or online services like YouTube, Vimeo and Revision3. There's also a remote control feature for Plex Media Center. Additionally, you can sign up for the myPlex service, which lets you connect to servers shared with you by your friends, queue videos from your web browser to watch later, and connect to your Plex Media Server at home wherever you are in the world via Wi-Fi or a celluar connection, with no configuration necessary! Plex Media Server streams your media directly from your computer, so there's no need to convert before viewing. Plex is smart, too - if your media isn't already in a format your device can play, it'll convert it on-the-fly.</li>
