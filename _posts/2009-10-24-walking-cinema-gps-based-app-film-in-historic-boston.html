<p style="text-align: left">Part movie, part stroll, and part participatory theater,  “Walking Cinema:  Murder on Beacon Hill,” is a unique opportunity to walk around in the scenery, conflicts, and artifacts of an historical film.  Working with a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities and in partnership with the original PBS filmmakers, Untravel Media of Boston worked with Raizlabs to develop a unique iPhone application that leads audiences along a mile path in Boston’s oldest neighborhood strewn with encounters, clues, and artifacts from a true story of a Harvard Professor accused of killing and dismembering a Brahmin in 1849.</p>
<p>The application is free for a limited time and can be downloaded from the App Store or from <a href="http://www.parkmanmurder.com">www.parkmanmurder.com</a>.</p>
