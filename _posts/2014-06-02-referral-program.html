<p>How many companies do you know pay you to go on a trip? Not many.</p>
<p>Over the years, Raizlabs issued several referral bonuses to employees who brought new people onboard. This practice is not uncommon. It's fairly typical for an employer to cut a check if you bring someone onboard.</p>
<p>Yes, of course the bonus is appreciated, and is certainly an incentive. But, the check is not a "Woo-hoo!" moment. In fact, it's "Ho-Hum." For example, do you remember what you did with your refund from seven years ago?</p>
<p>Starting this year, if you refer someone to Raizlabs and they are hired, we will send you on an all-expenses paid vacation. That's right. We will fly you and a friend to a sunny beach or a snowy ski slope on a four-day getaway.</p>
<p>Not into sandy beaches or snow-covered mountains? That's okay, take a look at the other vacations we offer:</p>

<p>We created this referral program because we understand the importance of building great experiences, not only for our clients, but for our employees. We wanted to give people something to be excited about.</p>
<p>It's important to note that this program is not limited to employees. Parents, friends and even our competitors are welcome to participate. Our growth as a company is bounded only by our ability to find and attract world-class people.</p>
<p>The fine print:</p>
<ol>
<li>Referral Eligibility: You must be 21 years or older to participate.  This program is open to parents, friends, and even competitors. Human Resources personnel, recruiters, and Raizlabs managers with hiring authority over the referred candidates are not eligible for participation.</li>
<li>The referral must represent the candidate's first contact with Raizlabs (i.e., this is the first time the candidate is applying to Raizlabs) and the referral must be made by the referrer via the online form to be eligible for the award.</li>
<li>Temporary, summer, contract and former employees of Raizlabs will not qualify referrers for the award.</li>
<li>The hired employee must be employed with Raizlabs for 60 days in order for the referrer to qualify for an award.</li>
<li>All vacation packages must be taken within a 2-year period from the day the new employee has completed his/her initial 60 days of employment with Raizlabs.</li>
<li>Raizlabs reserves the right to plan all trips.  Trip locations are subject to availability and may change.</li>
<li>The value of the trip is not to exceed $3,000 and trip expenses are subject to the Raizlabs Travel and Meals Policy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Earned trips may not be transferred and must be accepted as awarded.  The value of a trip may be treated as income to a referrer and the referrer may be responsible for reporting and payment of income taxes.</p>
<p>So who's ready? Come on down!</p>
