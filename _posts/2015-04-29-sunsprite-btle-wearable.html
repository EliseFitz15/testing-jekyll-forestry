<h2>Wearable meets Mobile</h2>
<p>SunSprite, with their first-of-its-kind Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) wearable device, is focused on being in the forefront of health technology by providing a solution to sunlight tracking.</p>
<p>Lack of sufficient bright light exposure can contribute to a spectrum of health issues such as depression, sleep problems, low energy, and difficulty focusing. SunSprite chose to partner with Raizlabs to launch a mobile app that would compliment the functionality of their wearable and complete the on-the-go experience of sunlight tracking.</p>

<h2>Designing for data</h2>
<p>Raizlabs built an intuitive and delightful experience connecting effortlessly to their hardware. By utilizing graph visualizations, we helped users understand their sun exposure in realtime. To keep users on track, the app employs notifications at milestone intervals and rewards users for attaining their light levels.</p>
<p>To power the user experience, Raizlabs' engineering team strategically built a custom low-cost, scaleable backend with Kinvey to support a growing startup.</p>
