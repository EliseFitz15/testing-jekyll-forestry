NORTH BILLERICA, MA (October 2011) - Early development educators have a new tool. Curriculum Associates, worked with Raizlabs to develop a new iPad application that provides users of the BRIGANCE Early Development and Online Management System an easy and convenient way to assess and report scores directly using the iPad.<br />

The new iPad app does away with many of the manual steps that were previously associated with measuring and recording assessment data. The iPad app allows observations directly on an iPad and then sync the data seamlessly with the Curriculum Associates online system.   The new app has made the process of recording IED II assessment data and instantly generating reports easier.</p>
<p>“Being able to use an iPad application for recording IED II assessment data and noting observations means educators are no longer entering data manually after an assessment is administered,” said Robert L. Waldron, president and CEO of Curriculum Associates. “In addition to increasing ease-of-use of the data collection, we’ve kept key elements of the original printed version of the Record Book so teachers can easily transition to this technology-enabled process using their iPad.”</p>
<p>Additionally, the IED II Record Book application allows teachers to view student details such as date of birth and parent or caregiver information; save personal notes and record assessment methods used to administer each assessment; create and e-mail a PDF of a student’s iPad Record Book; and more.</p>
