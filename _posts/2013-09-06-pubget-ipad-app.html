<h1>MAKING A VAST RESEARCH LIBRARY AVAILABLE ANYWHERE.</h1>
<h2>ALL IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE</h2>

<h2>Getting Results</h2>
<p>By expanding their online presence to iPad, Pubget was able to get its content in more places, in front of more users.</p>
<h2>How it Happened</h2>
<p>Raizlabs took a good look at Pubget.com, the company's primary search tool for content discovery. We wanted to be sure that the iPad app we designed and developed would meet the expectations of Pubget's audience of researchers.<br />
