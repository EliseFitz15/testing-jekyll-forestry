<p>The attention to detail, fun mobile shopping experience, and kooky animations from the unified suite of B&amp;H apps created by Raizlabs and B&amp;H, were just a couple of things that gained Internet Retailer Magazine's editors attention this year.</p>
<p>B&amp;H Photo Video, the largest non-chain photo and video equipment store in United States, was named one of <a href="http://www.internetretailer.com/hot100/">Internet Retailer Magazine's Hot 100 E-Retailers of 2013</a> on December 5.</p>
<p>In November, B&amp;H released a responsive design website that Internet Retailer Magazine named "Universal and Responsive." B&amp;H and Raizlabs <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/2013/11/bh-ios-android/">worked together to provide an industry-leading shopping experience</a> with a unified suite of apps available for iOS and Android. Bill Siwicki, Internet Retailer Magazine Mobile Commerce Managing Editor, <a href="http://www.internetretailer.com/2013/12/05/bhphotovideocom-apps-universal-and-responsive">wrote that a single universal app is "rare in retail."</a></p>
<p>"The app offers stunning, high-quality pictures to devices with Apple's super-high-definition Retina Display screen," Siwicki wrote.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BH3.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6233" alt="BH3" src="http://www.raizlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BH3.png" width="1101" height="842" /></a></p>
<p>Raizlabs Product Manager Jenn Pleus said, "It's always great working with B&amp;H because they are always looking to innovate in the mobile space and really allow us to be creative."</p>
<p>B&amp;H's responsive design website, and unified suite of apps, offers a unique mobile experience for consumers on iOS and Android.</p>
<p>B&amp;H was selected after careful evaluation from Internet Retailer Magazine editors. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Internet Retailer Magazine editors view thousands of websites a year, from personal searching, to recommendations from industry experts, and submitted websites. Each editor nominates about 20 sites for consideration, and vote up or down until a final list is compiled. They look for those that push e-retailing's boundaries.</span></p>
<p>According to Internet Retailer Magazine's website, the e-retailers featured in this issue "are all doing their part to advance the retail industry in delivering top-notch shopping opportunities to consumers through the web."</p>
<p>"Sites are also evaluated against their competitors to confirm that the nominated site is indeed doing something worth writing about," according to Internet Retailer Magazine's website.</p>
