<h1 style="text-align: left">SOLVING FOR ENLIGHTENMENT</h1>
<p>Following the successful launch of an HTML5 mobile web app, Athenahealth re-engaged Raizlabs to solve a new problem: create a responsive web app to help them educate potential clients about the benefits their products could deliver to the modern day medical practice.</p>
<p>After some brainstorming, we proposed the idea of an illustrated quiz that office managers and physicians could take that would allow them to quickly evaluate their practice costs and promote Athenahealth as the solution to their business needs.</p>

<h1>CULTIVATING ENGAGEMENT</h1>
<p>Raizlabs’ design team developed fun, animated sequences that responded as the user progressed through the quiz to create an engaging and informational experience. To bring the interface to life, we employed AngularJS, allowing for smooth interactions across desktop and mobile devices.</p>
<p>The engineering team executed a Ruby on Rails backend that gave athenahealth something they didn’t have before: flexibility. Athenahealth’s marketing team now has the freedom to update calculations, add content, or analyze data collected from the quiz. This provides a great improvement over the previously hard coded CMS that made it nearly impossible for any type of dynamic editing.</p>
