<p>Today we're unleashing <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.raizlabs.wordpopr&amp;hl=en">WordPopr for Android</a>. For the RZcurious, WordPopr (then "Word Popper" which found itself on more than fifty thousand devices), first appeared for iOS back in 2009 and was the first game developed by Raizlabs.</p>

<p>The goal of the game is simple: complete as many words on the board as possible before time runs out. Those with strong vocabularies and particularly swift thumbs will likely find themselves on the top of the leaderboard.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.raizlabs.wordpopr"><img class="alignright wp-image-7020 size-medium" src="http://www.raizlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/download_screenshot-168x300.png" alt="download_screenshot" width="168" height="300" /></a> WordPopr is a home-brewed app and side project that allowed us to exercise our chops for animation and interactions on Android. But mostly, we built this app for fun, notes Greg Raiz, Raizlabs Founder and CEO.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Our company believes in changing the world through great software, and part of that is injecting a bit of fun into what we do. Designing around the elements of game mechanics help us produce excellence in many of our other apps. Gaming has always pushed on the bounds of technology and designing something that is simple and fun solely for the purpose of being fun is a great expression of that belief,"</p></blockquote>
<p>Go ahead, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.raizlabs.wordpopr&amp;hl=en">give it a play </a>and let us know what you think. And be sure to turn your volume up to hear the original game music by our very own developers, Nick and Dylan. They developed a custom sound effects component just for WordPopr!</p>
