<h1>How To Evaluate a Mobile App Development Company</h1>
<p>So you need to build a mobile app.</p>
<p>Finding a 3rd party <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/">mobile app developer</a> is easy, but finding the <em>right</em> app development agency or firm to work with can be insanely tricky. Deciding who to partner with for your <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/services/">mobile app design and development</a> is no easy decision — which mobile app development company do you choose? How do you evaluate potential partners? What is their process? What is important to you? All of these are important considerations.</p>
<p>Building digital products is hard. Choosing the wrong partner could mean months of delay, buggy and bad code when it finally does ship, a poorly designed user experience, and worst of all - tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars wasted.</p>
<p>Selecting the right mobile app development firm could mean the difference between a profitable mobile business for you, and wasting money on useless code only to die a painfully slow business death. It’s important to fully research, evaluate, and vet each potential partner you work with.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of signals to evaluate if a mobile development company actually is credible, if they can deliver on time, if their pricing is in line with the work they produce, and so on. But all this information is completely spread out, and you really need to do your homework before picking that one perfect partner for you. This is inevitably a lengthy process and will involve research, lots of reading, in-person meetings, and internal team discussions. The end result: a great app (hopefully).</p>
<p>Here at <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/">Raizlabs</a> we have a lot of experience in this area. And for many companies, <strong>we are that perfect mobile app developer</strong>.</p>
<p>In hopes of setting you on the right track in your search for the perfect mobile development agency (and an awesome app!), I’ve aggregated a few specific things we’re frequently asked by potential clients.</p>
<hr />
<h1>6 things to keep in mind as you evaluate a mobile app development firm:</h1>
<h3><span style="color: #ec594d">1. Ability to ship on time</span></h3>
<p>This one is pretty simple: can your app development partner hit deadlines, every time? Not shipping on time is probably the hardest hitting thing in terms of cost and wasted opportunity for you. You want to make sure that the company you spend tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars with is going be able to make good on their promises.</p>
<p>Here at Raizlabs we have an entire team dedicated to make sure our client’s app ship. Dedicated Product Managers are tasked with the day-to-day of client projects, and <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/team/gary-fortier/">our COO</a> makes sure everyone has everything they need to blaze through projects.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ec594d">2. Client references</span></h3>
<p>One of the first things you’ll look at is a <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/work/">portfolio of the app development company’s past work</a> (you’ll probably do this even before you contact them). You’ll want to see which brands they’ve worked with, and the types of problems they’ve solved; this will give you a good indication of what they can provide you.</p>
<p>Client references are important in this stage. Being able to hear - first hand - from someone that’s previously worked with the firm or agency is <strong>extremely</strong> valuable. They’ll either be able to re-affirm everything the agency is pitching to you (that they’re awesome), or they’ll tell you what really goes on after the contracts are signed and checks are cut.</p>
<p>Here are Raizlabs the majority of <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/work/">our clients</a> actually sign with us for additional work. The fact that our clients are so satisfied with the work we produce that they engage us more than once is a testament (we feel) to our process and the level of work we produce. Our clients love working with us, and we love making great digital products — what could be a better combination?</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ec594d">3. Where is design and development done?</span></h3>
<p>You can surely get an app made for cheap if you outsource design and development to places like India, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia. Although this seems like an attractive option because of cost, we always advise prospective clients of the following:</p>
<p>There’s a cost vs. quality dynamic when it comes to outsourcing your development. It will be cheap and you might get a finished product, but chances are that it won’t be work of the same quality that a leading agency can give you. We <em>always</em> advise potential clients to <strong><em>never</em></strong> outsource development of their app.</p>
<p>All of our work here at Raizlabs is done by <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/company/the-team/">experienced engineers in our Boston and San Francisco offices</a>.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ec594d">4. Will experienced engineers be working on your app, or junior engineers?</span></h3>
<p>The old saying rings true: “you get what you pay for”. Just like where design and development is done, <em>who</em> design and development is done by is also important too.</p>
<p>A lot of agencies and firms will charge less because your app is being built by inexperienced engineers. For some clients, they’re okay with that. Other times clients expect a certain level of craftsmanship that can only come with experienced, top-notch talent.</p>
<p>There’s also more risk of a project derailing with an inexperienced agency. If completing your mobile app on time is a priority, experienced engineers and designers will be able to finish your project and ship <strong>on time</strong>. After talking to so many prospective clients, I’ve heard plenty of horror stories of projects kicking off and little progress achieved after months and months of work.</p>
<p>Here at Raizlabs, software engineers have an average of 10 years of experience in software development. Additionally, they have an average of 4 years of experience in mobile development - which is pretty crazy when you take into account that the App Store has only been around for 6 years. Our engineers have also shipped an average of 5.2 apps <em>outside</em> of Raizlabs.</p>
<p>We frequently say that we only hire <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/company/the-team/">the best and brightest</a> (statistically we’re more selective than Harvard), and we also only hire the most <em>experienced</em> software developers.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ec594d">5. Are they going to give you a whitelabel app, or build you a fully custom app?</span></h3>
<p>Some mobile app development agencies will reskin a whitelabel app, and essentially jerry rig it to suit your needs. This may be completely fine for some companies depending on the situation - a lot of apps for conferences and trade shows can probably just be white labeled since they pretty much all require the same functionality. This may be attractive for any company because it saves on cost, but at the end of the day it doesn’t usually suit your individual needs. 99 out of 100 companies are going to want a custom app designed and developed. Opting for the less expensive white label solution can be detrimental and end up being more of a cost sink instead of a cost savings.</p>
<p>In the end, you should decide which route is best for you, your project, and your company’s mobile app. Occasionally a whitelabel mobile app is exactly what a company or individual needs. Most often this is not the case and many companies are going to want a <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/services/">custom app built</a> for their specific needs.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ec594d">6. What is the app developer's process?</span></h3>
<p>Does the agency’s process ensure that your app will be shipped on time? And if it doesn’t ship on time, does the agency’s process ensure that you know why your app is behind schedule?</p>
<p>This is most valuable when you’re mid-project. A good agency will have a process where they will be able to identify, mid-project, if it’s on track to be completed by the deadline or not.</p>
<p>Process is also important because it not only ensures that your app ships by the deadline, but that it’s also built <em>right</em>. Before we even pick up a pencil or a mouse we have a massive kickoff session where we define the product and its features. At that point we then start designing and building the app. Our motto is “show early, and often”, so we include our clients in every bit of progress.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/company/">We are an agile company</a>, and operate in two week sprints. Every step of the way our clients are aware of our progress because we communicate the project burndown with them. Our clients know exactly where “on track” for the project theoretically is, and exactly where we are (if we’re on track, ahead of schedule, or behind schedule). That way if a project is going to take longer than initially expected, they know weeks and months ahead and not two days before the deadline.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Selecting a <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/">mobile app development company</a> is not easy and you definitely want to be thorough with your decision. A mistake means it may cost you twice as much to make a mistake, learn from it, and go with a reputable mobile development agency. You’ll probably be limited primarily by cost and choosing a cheaper option may seem attractive on the surface. We occasionally have clients that used less expensive agencies, and discovered all of this the hard way. It is my hope that you can take these points with you as you prepare for selecting a partner in the <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/services/strategy-mobile/">app development process</a>.</p>
<p>The most important thing to do is evaluate mobile development agencies on their pitches, their past work, and talk to some of their current and former clients (client references). This will give you the clearest sense of the app developer’s capabilities, process, and ability to ship on time.</p>
<p>Raizlabs is a <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/">digital interactive firm</a> that creates elegant software solutions to your hardest problems. We partner with everyone from startups to Fortune 500 companies to build unique mobile experiences.</p>
