This week's regular podcast crew included Greg Raiz (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/graiz" target="_blank">graiz</a>), Jon Green (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/gildedsplinter" target="_blank">gildedsplinter</a>), Joe Goullaud (@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/jgoullaud" target="_blank">jgoullaud</a>) and Michelle Buchman (@<a href="http://twitter.com/tres_michelle" target="_blank">tres_michelle</a>).

<p>Apps and other cool things discussed in this weeks podcast include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kirby Turner's book <em>Learning iPad Programming</em> can be purchased <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/learningipadprogramming" target="_blank">here</a>. <em>Learning iPad Programming</em> is written for programmers new to iOS and iPad programming as well as experience iPhone programmers wishing to jump start their iPad programming skills. Readers will get hands on with iPad programming by building different iPad applications.</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spelltower/id476500832?mt=8" target="_blank">SpellTower</a> - Looking for a word game that goes beyond a simple Scrabble/Boggle/Jumble clone? SpellTower is for you. Pick your words wisely! As you work, more tiles rise from the bottom of the screen, and it'll take all of your lexicological wits and tactical know-how to keep them down. If any of the letters make it to the top row, it's game over.</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id502385074?mt=8" target="_blank">Drafts</a> - Drafts is the quick, easy way to capture and share text. In Drafts, text comes first – open the app and get a new, blank draft – ready to type. Don't get bogged down in a timeline just to tweet or post to Facebook. Don't tap your way through multiple screens to get down an email or SMS. Don't navigate folders, create files and name them just to jot down a note or create a todo. In Drafts you can get that text down quickly and decide what to do with it later. Extensive output options let you send text to Twitter, Facebook, email, SMS, a Calendar event, quickly save it to Dropbox or Evernote – or forward it to a growing list of other Apps such as OmniFocus, Things, The Hit List, Byword, Sparrow and more.</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/felix-for-app.net/id562447652?mt=8" target="_blank">Felix for App.net</a> - Felix is a fast and beautiful iPhone client for the hot new App.net social network, also known as Alpha or ADN. Feature-rich and polished to a fine sheen, Felix is here to help you get the most out of your conversations with your new friends. What's more, it's ready for the awesome new iPhone 5 and iPod Touch!</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scribblenauts-remix/id444844790?mt=8" target="_blank">Scribblenauts</a> - Help Maxwell acquire the Starite by creating any object, bringing it to life and using it to solve each challenge. Let your imagination run wild in this groundbreaking puzzle game. Summon to life a ‘colossal, winged car’ or a ‘shy, frost-breathing, robotic hippopotamus’! If you can think it, you can create it.</li>
